## Holt Ventures Investment Context

**Investor Profile:**
- **Capital Available:** $200k for first acquisition
- **Purchase Price Target:** $75-200k per business
- **Background:** Systems building, regulatory compliance (NRC/nuclear), speed to competence
- **Constraints:** Full-time jobs (need remote/weekend-manageable businesses)

- **Hold Period:** 4-6 years
- **Target Returns:** 25-35% IRR, 3-5x MOIC
- **Geography:** Southern California preferred, open to other metros

**Investment Thesis - Must Validate:**
Target businesses should have:
1. ✅ **Regulatory/licensing moat** - Deters casual entrants
2. ✅ **50%+ recurring revenue** - Contracts, mandated compliance, renewals
3. ✅ **Process-driven operations** - Can systematize, not craft-dependent
4. ✅ **Remote/weekend manageable** - No daily on-site presence required
5. ✅ **Clear automation opportunity** - AI/software creates defensibility
6. ✅ **Fragmented market** - 100+ potential acquisition targets
7. ✅ **Retiring owner demographic** - Baby boomer exit wave
8. ✅ **Low AI disruption risk** - Physical work, regulatory approval required

**Macro Tailwinds to Assess:**
- **Reshoring & Critical Infrastructure:** Manufacturing returning to US
- **AI Disruption:** Businesses with resilience or leverage opportunity
- **Regulatory Complexity:** Increasing compliance requirements

## Output Requirements

### File Structure
Save report to organized directory:
```
/Users/andylee/Projects/micro-pe/industry-research/[business-type-slug]/report.md
```

**Example paths:**
- `/industry-research/backflow-testing/report.md`
- `/industry-research/calibration-services/report.md`
- `/industry-research/specialty-insurance-brokers/report.md`

### Quality Checklist
Before considering research complete, verify:

- [ ] **Length:** 8,000-12,000 words (check word count)
- [ ] **Structure:** All 10 sections fully completed (no TBDs or placeholders)
- [ ] **Investment Rating:** Clear STRONG BUY / BUY / HOLD / AVOID with conviction X/10
- [ ] **Quantification:** Market size ($X-Y billion), margins (X-Y%), multiples (X-Xx)
- [ ] **Sources:** 15-20+ sources cited with dates
- [ ] **BizBuySell Analysis:** Actual search results documented (# listings, prices, multiples)
- [ ] **Financial Model:** 5-year IRR calculated with assumptions documented
- [ ] **Licensing Specificity:** Exact license names (not just "license required")
- [ ] **Risk Register:** 10+ specific risks identified with mitigations
- [ ] **Actionability:** 30-day plan with weekly tasks and success metrics

### Writing Quality Standards

**GOOD Examples:**
- "Backflow testing market size is $800M-$1.2B in the US (2025), growing at 5-7% CAGR driven by new construction (+4.2% annually per Census Bureau) and stricter water safety regulations (Source: American Backflow Prevention Association 2025 Industry Report)"
- "Typical SMB generates $350-500k revenue with 4 employees (1 manager, 3 techs), achieving 35-45% SDE margins. BizBuySell analysis of 23 listings shows entry multiples of 2.5-3.5x SDE."

**BAD Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):**
- "The backflow testing market is large and growing" ❌ (not quantified)
- "Margins are good" ❌ (no numbers)
- "Competition is moderate" ❌ (vague)
- "License required" ❌ (which license? from whom?)

### Critical Success Factors

Your research will be evaluated on:

1. **Actionability:** Can Holt Ventures immediately begin deal sourcing? (Clear target profile, sourcing channels identified)
2. **Data Quality:** Are claims supported by cited, dated sources? (No hand-waving)
3. **Quantification:** Are key metrics in numbers not adjectives? ($X revenue not "high revenue")
4. **Completeness:** Are all 10 sections fully written? (No skipping)
5. **Investment Clarity:** Is there a definitive STRONG BUY/BUY/HOLD/AVOID with conviction level?

## Special Research Notes

### For Licensing Research
- Identify SPECIFIC license names (e.g., "California C-16 Fire Protection Contractor License" not "contractor license")
- Determine transferability: Does license transfer with business sale or require new application?
- Provide pathways: Can buyer obtain license? How long? Can buyer hire licensed person as "qualifying party"?
- Research cost: Initial licensing fees, annual renewal costs, continuing education requirements
- Check enforcement: Are licenses actually checked/enforced or paper-only?

### For BizBuySell Research
- Search multiple keyword variations (some businesses listed under different categories)
- Document ACTUAL listings (copy business names, listing IDs, for verification)
- Calculate multiples yourself (don't trust listing descriptions)
- Note staleness (listings >6 months old may be unrealistic pricing)
- Look for patterns: Are all listings from one broker? (May indicate thin market)

### For Financial Modeling
- Use REAL data from BizBuySell listings (not hypotheticals)
- Show your work: Document all assumptions clearly in table format
- Test sensitivity: Create data table showing IRR under different scenarios
- Be conservative: Bear case should assume things go somewhat wrong
- Include distributions: Model annual cash distributions during hold period, not just exit

### For Risk Assessment
- Be skeptical: This is investor protection, not marketing document
- Identify common issues: Customer concentration, owner dependency, license transfer problems
- Provide SPECIFIC mitigations (not just "monitor closely" or "manage carefully")
- Rank by severity: Focus deep dive on top 3 highest-impact risks
- Include probability: Risk = Probability × Impact (both matter)

### For Investment Recommendation
- Take clear stance: No hedging with "it depends" - say STRONG BUY / BUY / HOLD / AVOID
- Explain conviction: Why X/10 and not higher/lower? What would increase/decrease conviction?
- Connect to thesis: Explicitly score against Holt Ventures' 8 investment criteria
- Compare to alternatives: Is this better or worse than other business types researched?
- Set decision criteria: Under what conditions should Holt Ventures pursue this (e.g., "Only if customer concentration <25%")?

## After Research Completion

Once report is written and saved:

1. **Provide Executive Briefing**
   - Summarize investment recommendation in 3-4 sentences
   - Highlight top 3 pros and top 3 cons
   - State conviction level and rationale
   - Recommend next action (start deal sourcing / conditional pursuit / pass)

2. **Flag Critical Findings**
   - Any surprising discoveries (positive or negative)
   - Deal flow reality vs. expectation
   - Risks that could be deal-breakers
   - Opportunities not apparent in initial hypothesis

3. **Suggest Comparisons**
   - Which other business types from holt-ventures.md are similar?
   - Should Holt Ventures research those for comparison?
   - Is this a clear winner or should they keep looking?

## Example Invocation

**User:** `/research-business-type backflow-testing`

**Your Actions:**
1. Execute 5-phase research methodology (4-8 hours of web research)
2. Write comprehensive 8,000-12,000 word report covering all 10 sections
3. Save to `/industry-research/backflow-testing/report.md`
4. Provide executive briefing summarizing key findings
5. Make clear recommendation: STRONG BUY (9/10 conviction) - begin deal sourcing immediately

**Your Output:**
"✅ Research complete: Backflow Testing & Cross-Connection Control

**Investment Recommendation:** STRONG BUY (9/10 conviction)

**Key Findings:**
- 90%+ recurring revenue from mandated annual testing (municipal water code requirement)
- Extremely low barrier to entry for acquirer: 1-2 week ASSE certification course ($500)
- 23 businesses identified on BizBuySell in California, asking prices $150-350k (2.8x SDE avg)
- Route-based service model = remote manageable with strong manager
- Physical testing moat = AI-proof (cannot automate on-site device testing)
- Fragmented market: 100+ small operators in SoCal, zero institutional PE competition
- Base case IRR: 51% over 5 years (buy at 3x SDE, exit at 6.5x EBITDA via strategic)

**Top Risks:**
1. Customer concentration common (60% of listings show concentration, screen for <25%)
2. Municipal budget cuts could reduce enforcement (low probability, high impact)
3. Long-term technology disruption via IoT sensors (10+ year horizon, not immediate threat)

**Recommended Next Action:**
Begin deal sourcing immediately. Join ASSE (American Society of Sanitary Engineering), build target list of 50 operators in LA/OC/SD counties, start owner conversations this week.
