# Docs Guide

This repo uses a single canonical PRD plus per‑feature workspaces.

## Canonical Product Doc
- `docs/prd.md` — vision, problem, roadmap, and success metrics in one place.

## Architecture
- `docs/architecture.md` — how the codebase is organized and how it supports the PRD.

## Feature Workspaces
- `docs/feature/*` — one folder per feature for design notes, plans, and research.

## Archive
- `docs/_archive/` — deprecated or superseded docs.
