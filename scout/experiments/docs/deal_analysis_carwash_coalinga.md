## CONCLUSION

This self-serve car wash in Coalinga, CA presents **significant risks at the current asking price of $625,000**. The combination of very low disclosed revenue ($90K), undisclosed cash flow, limited market size, and moderate competition creates substantial uncertainty about returns.

The primary value lies in the **real estate component** rather than business operations. The business itself appears to be underperforming based on revenue levels.

### Final Recommendation: **PASS**

**However**, this could become interesting at a **significantly reduced price ($450K-$500K)** with full financial disclosure. At that level, the real estate provides downside protection, and the weak competitive landscape (main competitor has 2.9⭐ rating) presents upside opportunity for an operator willing to invest in improvements.

### Risk-Adjusted Return Profile

- **At $625K**: Expected ROI <5% → ❌ NOT ATTRACTIVE
- **At $500K**: Expected ROI 8-10% → ⚠️ MARGINAL
- **At $450K**: Expected ROI 12-15% → ✅ POTENTIALLY INTERESTING

**Better opportunities likely exist** in larger markets with stronger revenue bases and better disclosed financial performance.
