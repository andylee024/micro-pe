**Ongoing Compliance Cost:**
- Annual license renewals: $2,000-$5,000
- Stormwater compliance: $3,000-$8,000
- Insurance (see section below): $10,000-$25,000
- Legal/consulting: $3,000-$10,000
- **Total Annual Compliance: $18,000-$48,000**

**Moat Strength: 8/10**

The regulatory moat is STRONG:
- 6-12 month pre-opening timeline deters opportunistic entrants
- $16K-$35K compliance cost before revenue starts
- Ongoing expertise required (environmental, title, hazmat)
- Violations carry severe penalties (fines, license suspension, criminal liability)
- Most entrepreneurs lack environmental compliance knowledge

**Advantage for Andy:** Acquiring existing licensed, compliant operation avoids 6-12 month delay and $16-35K in permitting costs. Due diligence MUST verify all licenses current and compliance robust.

### 2.3 Data & Pricing Moat

**Complexity Score: 7/10 (Traditional) → 9/10 (With Andy's Systems)**

The data/pricing moat is the LEAST defensible of the three traditional moats, but represents Andy's GREATEST OPPORTUNITY for competitive advantage.

**Traditional Data Moat (Incumbent Advantage):**

Established salvage yards accumulate proprietary knowledge:

1. **Part Pricing Knowledge**
   - Years of sales data on what parts sell for
   - Understanding of seasonal price fluctuations
   - Knowledge of high-demand vs. low-demand parts
   - Core values for rebuildable components
   - Scrap metal pricing trends

2. **Inventory Valuation**
   - Which vehicles yield highest part value
   - Vehicle make/model profitability analysis
   - Auction bidding strategies (what to pay for specific vehicles)

3. **Customer Relationships**
   - Repair shop buying patterns
   - Credit history/payment reliability
   - Preferred customers vs. one-time shoppers

4. **Supplier Networks**
   - Insurance auction relationships
   - Scrap metal buyer relationships
   - Equipment/service vendor relationships

**Problem: This Moat Is WEAK for Most Yards**

The reality:
- Most salvage yards have TERRIBLE inventory systems
- Pricing is gut-feel, not data-driven
- No systematic tracking of:
  - What parts are in inventory
  - Where parts are located
  - Historical pricing
  - Turn rates by part type
  - Profitability by vehicle make/model

Industry consultant quote: "Most yards don't know what they have, lose track of parts, pricing inconsistent."

**This Weakness = Andy's Opportunity**

### 2.4 Andy's Data Moat Transformation Strategy

By implementing sophisticated inventory and pricing systems, Andy can transform the weakest moat into the STRONGEST competitive advantage:

**Phase 1: Inventory Management System (Months 1-3)**

Build/implement comprehensive system with:

**Photo Documentation:**
- Photograph every vehicle upon arrival (360° exterior, VIN, damage)
- Photograph major components before removal (engine bay, interior, undercarriage)
- Photograph parts after removal and cleaning
- Store images in cloud-based database linked to VIN/part number

**Location Tracking:**
- Grid system for yard (A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.)
- Vehicle location tracking (where is each car in yard)
- Parts storage location (which shelf, which bin)
- GPS coordinates for large yards

**Part Cataloging:**
- VIN decoder integration (automatic vehicle specs from VIN)
- Parts interchange database integration (which vehicles share parts)
- Part condition grading (A/B/C quality tiers)
- Testing/functionality notes

**Search Functionality:**
- Customer calls: "I need a 2015 Honda Accord driver door"
- System instantly shows: In stock, Location B7, Condition A, $275, Photo available
- Response time: 30 seconds vs. 15 minutes for competitor

**Phase 2: Pricing Algorithm (Months 3-6)**

Develop automated pricing system:

**Data Sources:**
- eBay sold listings (actual market prices)
- Parts marketplace data (Car-Part.com, etc.)
- Historical internal sales data
- Competitor pricing (manual research initially)
- OEM new part prices (for discount calculation)

**Pricing Rules:**
- Base price from market data
- Condition adjustment (+20% for grade A, -20% for grade C)
- Demand adjustment (high-demand parts +15%, slow movers -15%)
- Age adjustment (older inventory discounted to move)
- Seasonal adjustment (AC compressors higher in summer)

**Dynamic Repricing:**
- Auto-adjust prices based on market data (weekly or monthly)
- Alert for pricing outliers (are we too high/low vs. market?)
- Clearance pricing automation (90+ day inventory auto-discount)

**Phase 3: Analytics & Optimization (Months 6-12)**

Build business intelligence dashboards:

**Vehicle Acquisition Optimization:**
- Track profitability by vehicle make/model
- Calculate: Parts revenue - Acquisition cost - Labor = Net profit per vehicle
- Identify: "Toyota Camry 2010-2015 = $1,200 average net profit"
- Use data to inform auction bidding strategy

**Inventory Turn Optimization:**
- Calculate turn rate by part type
- Flag: "Transmissions turn 4x/year, fenders turn 8x/year"
- Adjust acquisition strategy (favor high-turn parts)
- Alert for dead inventory (180+ days, candidate for aggressive discount)

**Customer Segmentation:**
- Track customer profitability (not just revenue)
- Identify: High-volume, fast-pay customers (give discounts to retain)
- Flag: Slow-pay or difficult customers (require COD)

**Workforce Optimization:**
- Track dismantler productivity (parts removed per hour)
- Identify: Fast dismantlers (bonus/promote), slow dismantlers (train/replace)
- Optimize: Which parts worth dismantling vs. just scrapping whole car

**Phase 4: Online Sales & Market Expansion (Months 12-24)**

Leverage inventory system for geographic expansion:

**eBay Store:**
- Auto-list high-value parts (engines, transmissions, $500+ items)
- Use photos from inventory system
- Sync inventory (sell part in-store, auto-remove from eBay)
- National reach vs. local-only competitors

**E-commerce Website:**
- Customer self-service part search
- Online ordering with local pickup or shipping
- SEO optimization (rank for "[car make] used parts [city]")

**Marketplace Integration:**
- Car-Part.com (industry standard B2B marketplace)
- Facebook Marketplace (B2C reach)
- Automated inventory feeds (no manual listing)

**Expected Impact:**
- Online sales: 20-30% of total revenue (vs. 5-10% for traditional yards)
- Geographic reach: National vs. 25-mile radius
- Customer acquisition cost: Lower (organic search vs. relying on walk-ins)

### 2.5 Total Moat Strength Assessment

**Combined Moat Rating: 9/10 (Exceptional)**

| Moat Component | Traditional Strength | With Andy's Systems | Defensibility |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Equipment/Real Estate | 9/10 | 9/10 | Very High |
| Regulatory | 8/10 | 8/10 | High |
| Data/Pricing | 5/10 | 9/10 | Medium → Very High |
| **Overall** | **7/10** | **9/10** | **Very High** |

**Key Insight:**

Most salvage yards benefit from equipment/real estate and regulatory moats, but fail to leverage potential data moat. Andy's systems expertise transforms the weakest moat into a powerful competitive advantage, creating a TRUE triple-moat business.

**Competitive Positioning Post-Improvements:**

After implementing Andy's systems, the business will compete as:
- **Technology leader** vs. traditional competitors (faster quotes, better inventory visibility)
- **Premium service provider** vs. self-service yards (testing, warranties, convenience)
- **Regional specialist** vs. national LKQ (better service, local relationships, faster response)
- **Online pioneer** vs. local competitors (national reach via e-commerce)

This positioning supports premium pricing (5-15% above market) while maintaining volume through superior service.

## 3. "MESSY YARD" VALUE CREATION PLAYBOOK

The Holt Ventures memo notes: "Undervalued when messy; operational leverage via inventory turns, cataloging/search, pricing discipline, and standardized dismantling workflows."

This section provides a detailed playbook for identifying, acquiring, and transforming undervalued salvage yards.

### 3.1 What Makes a Yard "Messy"?

**Operational Red Flags (Value Creation Opportunities):**

1. **Poor Inventory Management**
   - No computerized system (paper/memory based)
   - Can't quickly answer "do you have [part]?" phone calls
   - Lost parts (dismantled but can't find them)
   - No photos (can't show condition to customers)
   - No location tracking (spend 20+ minutes searching for parts)

2. **Pricing Inconsistency**
   - "Make me an offer" pricing (leaving money on table)
   - Underpricing valuable parts (don't know market value)
   - Stale pricing (haven't adjusted in years)
   - No distinction between condition grades
   - Emotional pricing (favorite car brand overpriced)

3. **Low Inventory Turns**
   - Dead inventory sits for years
   - No system to identify slow-moving stock
   - Prime yard space wasted on unsellable vehicles
   - Cash tied up in non-productive inventory

4. **Inefficient Dismantling**
   - Ad-hoc disassembly (no process)
   - Only remove easy/obvious parts
   - Leave valuable parts on vehicles sent to crusher
   - Slow dismantling (taking too long per vehicle)

5. **Limited Sales Channels**
   - Walk-in/phone only (no online presence)
   - No eBay or marketplace listings
   - Not listed on Car-Part.com network
   - Limited geographic reach

6. **Weak Financial Management**
   - Don't track profitability by vehicle make/model
   - Don't know true costs (labor, overhead allocation)
   - No budget or financial projections
   - Owner doesn't know which parts/customers most profitable

7. **Deferred Maintenance/Appearance**
   - Messy office, poor customer experience
   - Broken equipment (operating below capacity)
   - Safety issues (OSHA violations waiting to happen)
   - Environmental compliance gaps (risk of fines)

### 3.2 Identifying Undervalued "Messy" Yards

**Valuation Discount Analysis:**

Well-run salvage yards trade at:
- Revenue multiple: 0.83x (median)
- SDE multiple: 4.33x (median)
- Median asking price: $875,000
- Median revenue: $850,000
- Median SDE: $283,260

Calculation check: $283,260 × 4.33 = $1,226,316 (above median due to multiple dispersion)

**"Messy" Yard Discount:**

Disorganized yards trade at 30-50% discount:
- Well-run yard: 4.5x SDE
- Messy yard: 2.5-3.5x SDE
- Discount: 30-50%

**Example Scenario:**

| Metric | Well-Run Yard | Messy Yard | Improvement Potential |
|--------|---------------|------------|----------------------|
| Revenue | $850,000 | $600,000 | → $900,000 (+50%) |
| SDE | $283,000 | $150,000 | → $315,000 (+110%) |
| Multiple | 4.5x | 3.0x | → 4.5x (upon sale) |
| Valuation | $1,273,500 | $450,000 | → $1,417,500 |
| **Return** | - | **Purchase: $450K** | **Sell: $1.42M (3.2x)** |

**Target Profile for Andy:**

The ideal acquisition target:
- **Revenue:** $400-800K (small enough to be affordable, large enough to support improvements)
- **SDE:** $100-200K (25-30% margins indicate fundamentals sound, just poorly operated)
- **Asking Price:** $300-600K (3-4x SDE, below market multiple)
- **Inventory:** $75-150K (included or in addition to purchase price)
- **Years in Business:** 10+ years (established customer base, license/permits in place)
- **Owner Situation:** Retirement, burnout, health issues (motivated seller)
- **Location:** Within 60 minutes of Andy's location (manageable part-time initially)
- **Real Estate:** Leased preferred (lower capital requirement, can relocate if needed)

**Red Flags to Identify "Messy" But Fixable:**

Positive Red Flags (fixable operational issues):
- Owner answers phone "yeah, auto parts" (unprofessional but fixable)
- No website or terrible website (easy win)
- "I'll have to walk the yard and call you back" (inventory system opportunity)
- Inconsistent hours (owner burned out)
- Cluttered office, poor curb appeal (cosmetic fix)

Negative Red Flags (walk away):
- Environmental violations or EPA consent orders (liability)
- Expired dismantler license (regulatory risk)
- Lawsuit history (legal issues)
- Declining revenue trend (market problem, not operator problem)
- No financial records (can't verify SDE)

### 3.3 Due Diligence Checklist for "Messy" Yards

**Financial Due Diligence:**

□ 3 years tax returns (verify SDE)

| Plus: Cash flow during hold | ~$250K (2 years of distributions) |

**Total Cash-on-Cash Return:** ~230% over 3 years

This assumes part-time involvement initially (18 months), transitioning to systems-driven operation requiring 10-15 hours/week of Andy's time by month 18.

### 3.6 Keys to Successful "Messy Yard" Turnaround

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Owner Motivated to Sell** (retirement, health, burnout)
2. **Fundamentals Sound** (revenue stable/growing, margins reasonable)
3. **Fixable Problems** (operational, not structural)
4. **Andy's Time Availability** (need 20+ hours/week initially, then systems reduce to 10-15)
5. **Environmental Clean** (no contamination legacy issues)
6. **Strong General Manager or Willing Employee to Promote** (can't do 100% solo part-time)
7. **Capital for Improvements** (budget $50-100K beyond purchase for systems/equipment/marketing)

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

1. **Overestimating Speed of Improvements** (allow 18-24 months, not 6-12)
2. **Underestimating Time Requirement** (first 6 months very hands-on)
3. **Ignoring Environmental Risk** (one contamination issue wipes out gains)
4. **Neglecting Key Employee Retention** (tribal knowledge valuable)
5. **Over-Investing in Technology** ($50K system when $10K solution works)
6. **Changing Too Much Too Fast** (alienates customers and employees)

## 4. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS & UNIT ECONOMICS

### 4.1 Revenue Model & Unit Economics

**Typical Revenue Breakdown (by source):**

| Revenue Stream | % of Total | Gross Margin | Characteristics |
|----------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Used Parts Sales | 60-70% | 25-30% | Stable, recurring, high margin |
| Scrap Metal Sales | 20-30% | 10-15% | Volatile, commodity-linked |
| Core Returns | 5-10% | 20-25% | Specialty, requires expertise |
| Other (towing, delivery) | 0-5% | 40-50% | Ancillary services |

**Per-Vehicle Unit Economics:**

Average vehicle acquisition and processing:

**INPUT COSTS:**
- Vehicle acquisition cost (insurance auction): $1,000-$2,000 (average $1,500)
- Towing/transport: $100-$200
- Labor (dismantling): $200-$400 (8-16 hours @ $25-50/hr loaded)
- Fluids disposal: $50-$100
- Storage/carrying cost: $50-$150 (varies by hold time)
- **Total Cost Per Vehicle:** $1,550-$2,350 (average $1,900)

**OUTPUT REVENUE:**
- Parts sales: $3,000-$6,000 (highly variable by make/model)
- Scrap hull value: $300-$600 (depends on scrap metal prices)
- **Total Revenue Per Vehicle:** $3,300-$6,600 (average $4,500)

**UNIT PROFITABILITY:**
- Gross profit per vehicle: $1,400-$4,250 (average $2,600)
- Gross margin: 40-65% (average 58%)

**Key Variables Affecting Unit Economics:**

1. **Vehicle Make/Model** (MOST IMPORTANT)
   - High-value: Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, F-150 (high demand parts)
   - Low-value: Older domestic sedans, exotic/rare brands (low demand)
   - Profitability variance: 3-5x between best and worst vehicles

2. **Vehicle Age**
   - Sweet spot: 5-15 years old (parts still needed, not too old)
   - Too new: High acquisition cost, may be repairable (not true salvage)
   - Too old: Low parts demand, mostly scrap value only

3. **Damage Type**
   - Best: Front-end collision (engine/trans salvageable, body parts damaged but sellable)
   - Good: Side impact (many undamaged parts)
   - Poor: Fire damage, flood damage (most parts unsellable)

4. **Dismantling Efficiency**
   - Skilled dismantler: 40-60 parts removed in 8 hours
   - Unskilled: 20-30 parts removed in 8 hours
   - Each additional part = $30-$200 in incremental revenue

**Inventory Turn Analysis (CRITICAL METRIC):**

Industry data shows inventory turns are THE key profitability driver:

Example: $1,000 vehicle investment, 33% COGS, produces $3,000 in parts sales

| Turns/Year | Annual Revenue | Profit | ROI |
|------------|---------------|--------|-----|
| 1x | $3,000 | $1,000 | 100% |
| 2x | $6,000 | $2,000 | 200% |
| 4x | $12,000 | $4,000 | 400% |
| 6x | $18,000 | $6,000 | 600% |

Typical salvage yard: 2-3 turns/year
Well-managed yard: 4-6 turns/year
Andy's target: 5-6 turns/year

**Improving Turns:**
- Faster dismantling (SOPs, training)
- Better inventory visibility (system shows what's available)
- Active remarketing (clearance pricing on 90+ day inventory)
- Smarter acquisition (buy high-demand vehicles)

| Role | Hourly Rate | Annual Cost (Loaded) | Skills Required |
|------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Manager | $25-35/hr | $65-90K | Business, automotive, compliance |
| Dismantler | $18-25/hr | $45-65K | Mechanical aptitude, tools, physical |
| Parts counter | $16-22/hr | $40-55K | Customer service, automotive knowledge |
| Forklift operator | $17-23/hr | $42-58K | Forklift cert, safety, physical |

**Andy's Part-Time Labor Strategy (Year 1):**

To manage part-time initially (1.5 hrs weekdays, weekends OK):

1. **Promote/Hire Strong General Manager**
   - Critical: Need day-to-day operator
   - Compensation: $60-75K + profit sharing (5-10%)
   - Responsibilities: Daily operations, employee management, compliance
   - Andy's role: Systems, strategy, financials (nights/weekends)

2. **Retain Key Employees from Acquisition**
   - Offer retention bonuses (stay 12 months, get $5K bonus)
   - Minimal disruption to customer service
   - Leverage tribal knowledge (who knows what vehicles bring best return)

3. **Implement Productivity Systems**
   - Dismantler scorecards (parts per hour tracking)
   - Monthly bonuses for productivity targets
   - Cross-training (reduce key person dependencies)

**Recruiting & Retention:**

Challenges:
- Physical work deters many candidates
- Automotive knowledge required (not entry-level)
- "Junkyard" stigma
- All-weather outdoor work

Strategies:
- Pay 10-15% above market (attract better talent)
- Profit sharing (align incentives)
- Climate-controlled break area (basic comfort)
- Professional environment (vs. stereotypical "junkyard")
- Training/development (cross-training, forklift certs, OSHA)

**Young-People Deterrence (Supporting Investment Thesis):**

The labor requirements SUPPORT the "dirty, essential" moat:
- Dirty: Oil, grease, all-weather, physical labor
- Physical: Heavy lifting, manual work, standing all day
- Complexity: Need automotive AND business knowledge
- Stigma: "Junkyard" not prestigious

Result: Limited competition from younger entrepreneurs preferring SaaS/online businesses

### 5.2 Inventory Management System (Andy's Competitive Advantage)

This section details the core of Andy's competitive advantage: building a sophisticated inventory system where competitors have none.

**Problem Statement:**

Industry consultant: "Most salvage yards don't know what they have, lose track of parts, pricing inconsistent."

Typical salvage yard system:
- Paper-based or memory-based ("I think we have that, let me check")
- No photos (customer can't see condition before driving over)
- No location tracking (spend 20 minutes searching)
- Inconsistent pricing (different employees quote different prices)

Result: Lost sales, poor customer experience, low margins

**Andy's Solution: Comprehensive Inventory Management System**

**Build vs. Buy Analysis:**

**Option 1: Buy Existing Software ($150-500/month)**

Available platforms:
- **ScrapIT**: $150/month basic package, 30+ years in industry, comprehensive
- **My Yard Manager**: Web-based, no commitment, mobile-friendly
- **GreenSpark**: Modern interface, real-time tracking, barcode scanning
- **ScrapRight**: 200+ salvage yards using, wizard-based data entry
- **ReMatter**: QuickBooks/NetSuite integration, iOS/Android apps
- **CCC Pinnacle Yard Management**: Auction-to-crush workflow, customizable dashboards

Pros:
- Faster implementation (30-60 days)
- Lower upfront cost
- Tech support included
- Proven in industry

Cons:
- Monthly fees ($150-500 = $1,800-$6,000/year)
- Less customization for Andy's specific vision
- May lack advanced analytics/AI features
- Dependent on vendor

**Option 2: Build Custom System ($20-50K upfront)**

Technology stack:
- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL (open source)
- Backend: Python/Django or Ruby/Rails
- Frontend: React or Vue.js (web app)
- Mobile: React Native (iOS/Android apps for yard workers)
- Image storage: AWS S3 or Cloudinary
- Hosting: AWS or DigitalOcean ($100-300/month)

Features:
- Photo cataloging (unlimited storage)
- VIN decoder API integration (NHTSA vPIC free, or paid services)
- Parts interchange database (license from Hollander or build custom)
- Location tracking (custom grid system)
- Pricing algorithm (custom rules engine)
- Customer portal (self-service search)
- Analytics dashboard (profitability by vehicle, turn rates, etc.)

Pros:
- Complete customization
- AI/ML capabilities (Andy's expertise)
- Proprietary system (competitive moat)
- One-time cost, no monthly fees
- Can license/sell to other yards later (additional revenue)

Cons:
- Longer development (3-6 months)
- Higher upfront cost
- Andy must maintain/support
- Risk of scope creep

**Recommendation: Hybrid Approach**

Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Buy existing software
- Implement ScrapRight or ReMatter ($200-300/month)
- Get immediate operational improvement
- Learn what works/doesn't work
- Quick win for business (better service immediately)

Phase 2 (Months 6-12): Build custom enhancements
- Keep commercial software as foundation
- Build custom pricing algorithm (integrate via API)
- Build analytics dashboard (pull data from commercial system)
- Build customer-facing search (better UX than vendor's)
- Build mobile app for dismantlers (streamline data entry)

Phase 3 (Year 2): Decide full custom vs. stay hybrid
- If custom features proving valuable, migrate fully
- If commercial system sufficient, keep as-is and invest elsewhere

**Estimated Investment:**
- Year 1: $3,600 (software) + $15,000 (custom enhancements) = $18,600
- Year 2+: $3,600 (software) + $5,000 (maintenance) = $8,600/year

**System Functionality Requirements:**

**Core Module 1: Vehicle Intake**

Process:
1. Vehicle arrives (towed from auction or delivered)
2. Yard worker scans VIN (mobile app)
3. System auto-populates vehicle data (year, make, model, engine, trans via VIN decoder)
4. Worker photographs vehicle (360° exterior, interior, engine bay, VIN plate, damage)
5. Worker notes damage type, mileage, condition assessment
6. System assigns location (suggests empty spot, worker confirms)
7. System creates vehicle record, photos uploaded to cloud

Time: 10 minutes per vehicle (vs. 30+ minutes manual paperwork)

**Core Module 2: Dismantling Workflow**

Process:
1. Manager assigns vehicle to dismantler (mobile app notification)
2. Dismantler pulls up vehicle record, sees photos/VIN/specs
3. Dismantler begins part removal:
   - Scan/enter part removed (e.g., "driver door")
   - System suggests pricing (based on algorithm)
   - Dismantler photographs part (post-removal, cleaned)
   - Dismantler enters condition grade (A/B/C)
   - System assigns storage location (shelf/bin)
4. Part record created, linked to source vehicle
5. Repeat for all parts removed
6. When vehicle fully dismantled, mark for crushing

Productivity tracking:
- System logs time per vehicle (start/end timestamps)
- Calculates parts removed per hour
- Manager can see dismantler productivity trends

Time per part: 2-3 minutes (vs. 5-10 minutes manual logging)

**Core Module 3: Parts Sales & Customer Service**

Process:
1. Customer calls: "Do you have a passenger door for 2014 Honda Accord?"
2. Counter person searches inventory (types "2014 Honda Accord door")
3. System shows:
   - Match: 2014 Accord EX, passenger door, Condition A, Location B-7
   - Interchange matches: 2013-2017 Accord doors (compatible)
   - Photo of actual part
   - Price: $285
4. Counter person: "Yes, we have one in excellent condition, $285, I can text you a photo"
5. Customer: "I'll take it"
6. System generates invoice, updates inventory (marks part sold)
7. Worker retrieves part (system guides to Location B-7)

Time: 2 minutes (vs. 15 minutes calling customer back after yard search)

Customer experience: Immediate answer + photo = higher close rate

**Core Module 4: Pricing Algorithm**

Data sources:
- eBay sold listings (API integration, $500-1,000/month for commercial access)
- Car-Part.com marketplace data (scrape or partner)
- Internal historical sales (learn over time)
- OEM new part prices (for reference, show customer savings %)

Pricing logic:
```
Base Price = Median(eBay sold prices for part) × 0.85 (discount for used)

Adjustments:
+ Condition: A grade +20%, B grade +0%, C grade -20%
+ Demand: High demand +15%, Average +0%, Low demand -15%
+ Age: <30 days +0%, 30-90 days -10%, 90-180 days -25%, 180+ days -40%
+ Seasonality: AC parts +20% in May-Aug, -10% in Dec-Feb

Final Price = Base Price × (1 + sum of adjustment %)
```

Example:
- Part: 2015 Honda Accord alternator
- eBay median sold: $120
- Base: $120 × 0.85 = $102
- Condition A: +20% = $122
- High demand (Accord popular): +15% = $140
- Age <30 days: +0% = $140
- Final price: $140

Manual override: Manager can adjust (special customer, negotiation), but system logs variance

**Core Module 5: Analytics & Business Intelligence**

Dashboards:

**Vehicle Profitability Dashboard:**
- Table showing every vehicle dismantled (last 12 months)
- Columns: VIN, Make/Model/Year, Acquisition Cost, Parts Revenue, Scrap Revenue, Labor Hours, Net Profit, ROI %
- Sortable by profit, ROI
- Filter by make, model, year range, damage type
- Insight: "2012-2016 Honda Accord average $2,400 profit" → bid more aggressively at auction

**Inventory Turn Dashboard:**
- Current inventory age histogram (how many parts 0-30 days, 30-90, 90-180, 180+)
- Slow-moving inventory alert (parts >180 days, candidates for clearance)
- Turn rate by part category (engines 3.2x/year, fenders 6.8x/year)
- Cash tied up in slow inventory: $47,500 (opportunity cost)

**Customer Profitability Dashboard:**
- Top 20 customers by revenue
- Top 20 by profit (accounting for payment speed, discount %, return rate)
- Customer lifetime value calculation
- Payment terms vs. actuals (who pays net-30 vs. takes 45+ days)

**Dismantler Productivity Dashboard:**
- Parts removed per hour by employee
- Revenue generated per labor hour
- Quality metrics (return/warranty rate)
- Identifies top performers (reward) and training needs

**Expected ROI from System:**

Conservative estimate:

Improvements:
1. **Time Savings:** 5 hours/week (faster quotes, retrieval, inventory) × $25/hr = $6,500/year
2. **Lost Part Recovery:** 20% more parts found/sold (were lost previously) = $50,000 additional revenue × 25% margin = $12,500/year
3. **Pricing Optimization:** Stop underpricing by average 8% = $35,000 additional margin/year
4. **Inventory Turn Improvement:** 2.5x → 4.0x turns = 60% increase in effective capacity = $75,000 additional revenue × 25% margin = $18,750/year
5. **Online Sales Enabled:** $80,000 new revenue × 30% margin = $24,000/year

**Total Annual Benefit:** $91,750
**System Cost:** $18,600 (Year 1)
**ROI:** 393% in Year 1

Conservative assumptions (many yards report even larger impacts)

### 5.3 Business Model Variations: Full-Service vs. Self-Service

**Full-Service Model (Recommended for Andy):**

Characteristics:
- Yard removes all parts
- Parts cleaned, tested, stored on shelves
- Customers call or visit, parts brought to counter
- Warranty offered (45-90 days typical)
- Higher prices (convenience + warranty)
- Labor-intensive but higher margins

Pros:
- 25-30% gross margins on parts
- Warranty differentiation (builds trust)
- Professional image (vs. junkyard stereotype)
- Cleaner, safer customer experience
- Can serve both B2B and B2C effectively

Cons:
- Higher labor costs (dismantlers needed)
- Inventory storage space required
- Slower inventory turns (must dismantle first)

**Self-Service Model (U-Pull-It):**

Characteristics:
- Customers bring own tools
- Customers pull own parts
- Pay by part type (door $35, transmission $125, etc.)
- No warranty (as-is, where-is)
- Very low prices (70-90% discount vs. new)
- Minimal labor (cashiers only, no dismantlers)

Pros:
- Low labor costs (customers do the work)
- Fast inventory turns (no dismantling bottleneck)
- Scalable (can handle 1,000+ vehicles on lot)
- Lower skill requirements (don't need expert dismantlers)

Cons:
- Lower margins (10-15% vs. 25-30%)
- Liability concerns (customers using tools on-site)
- Limited to DIY market (shops won't send mechanics to pull parts)
- Requires larger yard (customers need access to all vehicles)
- Regulatory concerns (public access to hazmat)

**Recommendation for Andy: Full-Service**

Rationale:
1. **Higher Margins:** 25-30% vs. 10-15% (better ROI for smaller operation)
2. **Technology Advantage:** Andy's inventory system provides bigger edge in full-service (self-service customers don't care about your database)
3. **B2B Market:** Repair shops are more profitable customers, need full-service
4. **Smaller Scale:** Can operate on 2-5 acres (vs. 10-20 acres for self-service)
5. **Professional Positioning:** Aligns with "systems-driven, quality" brand vs. budget/DIY

**Hybrid Option (Advanced):**

Some yards operate hybrid model:
- Front of yard: Full-service showroom (clean, organized parts)
- Back of yard: Self-service section (budget customers can pull own parts)
- Pricing tiers: Self-service 50% discount vs. full-service pricing

Complexity: Higher (two business models to manage)
Opportunity: Year 2-3 expansion once full-service operations optimized

### 5.4 Dismantling Workflow Standardization

The Holt memo emphasizes "standardized dismantling workflows" as a value creation lever. Most salvage yards dismantle ad-hoc; SOPs create competitive advantage.

**Current State (Typical Salvage Yard):**

- Dismantler decides which parts to remove (based on personal judgment)
- No time standards (some take 6 hours, others 16 hours for same vehicle)
- Inconsistent part recovery (one dismantler removes 30 parts, another removes 60)
- No documentation (tribal knowledge not transferred)
- Quality variability (parts not properly cleaned/stored)

Result: Inefficiency, missed revenue, training difficulty

**Andy's SOP System:**

**Phase 1: Process Documentation (Months 1-3)**

Activity:
1. Shadow best dismantler for 2 weeks
2. Document every step (video recordings)
3. Time each activity (time-motion study)
4. Identify best practices

Deliverable: Written SOPs with photos/videos

**Phase 2: Vehicle-Specific SOPs (Months 3-6)**

Create checklists for common vehicle types:

**Example: Honda Accord SOP (2008-2017)**

Time target: 8 hours (1 workday)

**Hour 1: Fluid Removal & Exterior**
- [ ] Drain coolant into recovery tank (15 min)
- [ ] Drain oil into recovery tank (10 min)
- [ ] Remove battery, store in battery area (5 min)
- [ ] Remove all 4 wheels/tires (if good condition), store (20 min)
- [ ] Remove front bumper cover, inspect, store if sellable (10 min)

**Hour 2: High-Value Interior**
- [ ] Remove front seats (both), test power functions, store (25 min)
- [ ] Remove rear seats (15 min)
- [ ] Remove airbag (if not deployed), handle with care (15 min)
- [ ] Remove radio/navigation unit, test, store (5 min)

**Hour 3: Electrical Components**
- [ ] Remove alternator, test output, store (15 min)
- [ ] Remove starter, test, store (10 min)
- [ ] Remove AC compressor (if clutch engages), store (20 min)
- [ ] Remove power steering pump, store (10 min)
- [ ] Remove wiper motors, test, store (5 min)

**Hour 4-5: Engine/Transmission (if salvageable)**
- [ ] Disconnect all electrical/vacuum lines (30 min)
- [ ] Disconnect exhaust (15 min)
- [ ] Remove transmission (if rebuildable core), store (45 min)
- [ ] Remove engine (if rebuildable core), store on pallet (60 min)

**Hour 6: Body Panels**
- [ ] Remove doors (all 4), inspect, store (40 min)
- [ ] Remove hood, inspect, store (10 min)
- [ ] Remove trunk lid/hatch, inspect, store (10 min)

**Hour 7-8: Final Parts & Cleanup**
- [ ] Remove mirrors (if power), store (10 min)
- [ ] Remove headlight assemblies, store (15 min)
- [ ] Remove tail light assemblies, store (10 min)
- [ ] Remove any remaining high-value parts (discretionary)
- [ ] Document all removed parts in inventory system (30 min)
- [ ] Drain remaining fluids (gas, trans fluid) (20 min)
- [ ] Move to crush area (forklift) (10 min)

**Parts Removed:** 40-50 itemized parts
**Estimated Revenue:** $3,500-$5,000
**Labor Cost:** $200-250 (8 hrs × $25-31/hr)
**Gross Profit:** $3,250-$4,750 per vehicle

**Phase 3: Training Program (Ongoing)**

New Dismantler Onboarding (2 weeks):
- Week 1: Shadow experienced dismantler, follow SOPs
- Week 2: Dismantle under supervision, checklist compliance
- Certification: Must complete vehicle in <10 hours, 90% checklist compliance

Monthly Training:
- Review new SOPs (as developed for additional vehicle types)
- Safety training (OSHA compliance)
- Tool maintenance/care
- New technology (inventory system updates)

**Phase 4: Performance Management (Ongoing)**

KPIs tracked weekly:
1. **Vehicles Dismantled:** Target 5-6 per week per dismantler (1+ per day)
2. **Parts per Vehicle:** Target 45+ (indicates thorough dismantling)
3. **Revenue per Vehicle:** Target $4,000+ (removing high-value parts)
4. **Time per Vehicle:** Target <10 hours (efficiency)
5. **Quality:** Returns/warranty claims <2% (parts tested properly)

Incentive system:
- Base wage: $20/hr
- Productivity bonus: $50 per vehicle over weekly target (e.g., target 5, complete 7 = $100 bonus)
- Quality bonus: $200/month if returns <1%
- Total comp for strong performer: $50,000 base + $5,000-8,000 bonuses = $55-58K

**Expected Impact of SOPs:**

| Metric | Before SOPs | After SOPs | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Time per vehicle | 12 hours | 8 hours | 33% faster |
| Parts per vehicle | 30 | 45 | 50% more parts |
| Revenue per vehicle | $3,200 | $4,500 | 41% higher |
| Parts missed (left on vehicle) | 20% | 5% | 75% reduction |
| Training time (new employee) | 6 weeks | 2 weeks | 67% faster |

**ROI Calculation:**

Additional revenue from better dismantling:
- Before: 100 vehicles/year × $3,200 = $320,000
- After: 125 vehicles/year (efficiency) × $4,500 = $562,500
- Incremental revenue: $242,500
- At 25% margin: $60,625 additional profit

SOP development cost: $10,000 (Andy's time)
**ROI:** 506% in Year 1

### 5.5 Online Sales & Market Expansion Strategy

Traditional salvage yards are local businesses (25-50 mile radius). Online sales enable national reach, accessing larger market with higher prices.

**Phase 1: eBay Motors (Months 3-6)**

Why eBay:
- 109 million monthly active visitors
- Established fitment system (helps buyers find compatible parts)
- eBay Motors specific section (targeted audience)
- Cannot sell used parts on Amazon (policy restriction)

Setup:
- eBay store subscription: $27.95/month (250 listings included)
- Payment processing: 13.25% final value fee (includes payment processing)
- Shipping accounts: Commercial FedEx/UPS (30-40% discount vs. retail rates)

Strategy:
- List high-value parts ONLY (justify shipping cost)
  - Engines: $800-$3,000
  - Transmissions: $600-$2,500
  - Transfer cases: $400-$1,200
  - Electronics (navigation, clusters): $200-$800
  - Hard-to-find parts (discontinued models): $100-$500

Listing process (leverage inventory system):
- Select parts >$150 value
- Export photos from inventory system
- Auto-generate eBay listing (title, description, fitment)
- Set pricing: Local price + $50-100 (national market premium) + shipping
- Sync inventory (part sells locally, auto-remove from eBay)

Fulfillment:
- Package in-house (buy boxes/bubble wrap in bulk)
- Print shipping labels (eBay integration)
- Schedule pickup or drop at carrier

**Expected Results:**
- List 50-100 high-value parts
- Conversion rate: 15-20% per month (7-10 sales/month initially)
- Average sale: $600
- Monthly eBay revenue: $4,200-$6,000
- Annual eBay revenue: $50-70K (incremental)
- Margin: 30% (after eBay fees, shipping cost) = $15-21K profit

**Phase 2: Facebook Marketplace (Months 6-9)**

Setup:
- Facebook Business Page (free)
- Link Instagram account (free)
- Post listings manually or via automation tool ($50-100/month)

Strategy:
- Mid-value parts ($100-$500)
- Local + regional reach (200 mile radius)
- Photos from inventory system
- Respond quickly (mobile app notifications)

Advantage:
- No listing fees (vs. eBay)
- Local pickup option (avoid shipping cost)
- Casual buyers (DIY market)

**Expected Results:**
- 20-30 listings active
- 5-8 sales/month
- Average sale: $250
- Annual revenue: $15-24K (incremental)
- Margin: 35% (no eBay fees) = $5-8K profit

**Phase 3: E-commerce Website (Year 2)**

Once online sales prove viable, build dedicated site:

Platform options:
- Shopify with automotive plugin ($79-299/month)
- Custom built (integrate with inventory system)

Features:
- Self-service part search (Make/Model/Year selection)
- Photos and detailed condition descriptions
- Online checkout (credit card processing)
- Shipping calculator (zip code based)
- Warranty information
- Customer reviews

SEO strategy:
- Rank for "[car make/model] used parts [city]"
- Blog content (DIY repair guides)
- Part interchange guides
- Local citations (Google My Business, Yelp)

**Expected Results (Year 2):**
- Website revenue: $120-150K/year
- Margin: 32% (lower fees than eBay) = $38-48K profit

**Total Online Sales Projection:**

| Channel | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| eBay | $50-70K | $80-100K | $100-120K |
| Facebook | $15-24K | $30-40K | $40-50K |
| Website | $0 | $120-150K | $180-220K |
| **Total Online** | **$65-94K** | **$230-290K** | **$320-390K** |

Online % of total revenue:
- Year 1: 9-13%
- Year 2: 26-32%
- Year 3: 30-36%

This significantly exceeds industry average of 5-15% online sales.

**Competitive Advantage:**

Most salvage yards lack:
- Inventory system (can't efficiently list online)
- E-commerce expertise (don't know how to sell online)
- Willingness to ship (see as hassle)

Andy's technology + systems expertise = dominant online presence in local market
