### 7.2 Diligence Red Flags

**Automatic Disqualifiers (Walk Away If):**
- ❌ [e.g., Top 3 customers >30% of revenue]
- ❌ [e.g., Owner does 100% of technical work, no employees]
- ❌ [e.g., License non-transferable AND owner won't stay 12+ months]
- ❌ [e.g., Customer retention <70% annually]
- ❌ [e.g., Recurring revenue <40% (below thesis threshold)]

**Major Concerns (Require Deep Investigation):**
- ⚠️ [e.g., Customer concentration 25-30%]
- ⚠️ [e.g., No written contracts with customers]
- ⚠️ [e.g., Declining revenue trend (>10% drop year-over-year)]
- ⚠️ [e.g., Outstanding liens, lawsuits, regulatory violations]
- ⚠️ [e.g., Key employee indicated interest in leaving]

### 7.3 SWOT Analysis

**STRENGTHS:**
- ✅ [e.g., Highly recurring revenue model (90%+ mandated by law)]
- ✅ [e.g., Fragmented market with 100+ acquisition targets]
- ✅ [e.g., Low AI disruption risk (physical work)]
- ✅ [e.g., Clear automation opportunities for margin expansion]

**WEAKNESSES:**
- ⚠️ [e.g., Customer concentration common in SMB operators]
- ⚠️ [e.g., Labor-dependent (need to retain/hire technicians)]
- ⚠️ [e.g., Geographic limitations (route-based model)]

**OPPORTUNITIES:**
- 💡 [e.g., Roll-up strategy - acquire 3-5 businesses for route density]
- 💡 [e.g., Technology differentiation - most operators still manual]
- 💡 [e.g., Market growing X% annually driven by [tailwind]]

**THREATS:**
- ⚠️ [e.g., Municipal budget cuts could reduce enforcement]
- ⚠️ [e.g., Long-term technology disruption (IoT sensors)]
- ⚠️ [e.g., Competition from national consolidators]

- Show your work: Document assumptions clearly
- Test sensitivity: What variable matters most to returns?

**For Risk Assessment:**
- Be skeptical - what could go wrong?
- Red flag common issues: customer concentration, owner dependency, license transfer problems
- Provide specific mitigations (not just "monitor closely")

**For Investment Recommendation:**
- Take a clear stance: STRONG BUY / BUY / HOLD / AVOID
