1. **Business Brokers (40% of effort):**
   - National: BizBuySell, BusinessBroker.net, MergerNetwork
   - Regional: Sunbelt Business Brokers, Murphy Business, Transworld Business Advisors
   - **Tactics:** Set up automated alerts ("calibration," "NDT," "testing," "inspection"), review daily; reach out within 24 hours of new listing
   - **Pros:** Active sellers, financial documentation prepared
   - **Cons:** Higher prices (broker adds 10-15% to valuation), competitive process

2. **Direct Owner Outreach (30% of effort):**
   - **Data Sources:**
     - A2LA (American Association for Laboratory Accreditation) directory - ISO 17025 labs
     - ASNT member directory - NDT companies
     - State fire marshal licensed contractor lists
   - **Tactics:**
     - Mail campaign: Personalized letters to owners aged 55+ (public records), 2-3 touchpoints over 6 months
     - LinkedIn outreach: Connect with owners, share market insights (e.g., "Manufacturing Reshoring Impact on Cal Labs"), build relationship before offer
   - **Pros:** Off-market deals, less competition, negotiation flexibility
   - **Cons:** Longer sales cycle (12-24 months), owner may not be emotionally ready

3. **Industry Association Events (15% of effort):**
   - Conferences: ASNT Annual Conference, A2LA Annual Conference, NFPA Conference
   - Trade shows: ASTM, NCSL International (calibration), AHR Expo (fire protection)
   - **Tactics:** Attend sessions, sponsor networking events, collect business cards, follow up with "let's grab coffee" in seller's city
   - **Pros:** Build trust in-person, identify succession-minded owners, learn industry trends
   - **Cons:** Time-intensive, travel costs ($5k-$15k annually)

4. **Accountant/Attorney Referrals (10% of effort):**
   - CPA firms specializing in small business (target firms with 50-200 SMB clients)
   - Business attorneys (M&A, estate planning focus)
   - **Tactics:** Offer referral fee ($5k-$25k, 1-2% of deal), provide deal criteria one-pager, quarterly check-ins
   - **Pros:** High-quality referrals (financial scrutiny pre-screened), trusted advisor endorsement
   - **Cons:** Infrequent deal flow (1-2 deals/year per relationship)

5. **Digital Marketing (5% of effort):**
   - Website: "We Buy Calibration/Testing Businesses" landing page (SEO optimized)
   - Google Ads: Target keywords "sell my calibration business," "NDT company valuation"
   - **Tactics:** Offer free valuation report, capture leads, nurture with email sequence
   - **Pros:** Inbound leads, scalable
   - **Cons:** Low conversion rate (<5%), attracts tire-kickers

**Geographic Priority (Start Local, Expand):**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-12):** Target single metro area (e.g., Dallas, Houston, Orange County) - build density
- **Phase 2 (Months 13-24):** Expand to 2-3 adjacent metros within 150-mile radius - operational efficiency
- **Phase 3 (Months 25-36):** Evaluate out-of-region platform acquisition (e.g., Midwest if started in Texas) - geographic diversification

### 8.3 Key Questions for Owner Conversations

**Financial Due Diligence:**
1. What percentage of revenue is from recurring annual contracts vs. one-time projects?
2. What are your top 5 customers by revenue, and what % of total revenue do they represent?
3. Can you provide 3 years of P&L statements and last 2 years of tax returns?
4. What is your average DSO (days sales outstanding), and do you have any past-due AR >90 days?
5. What are your planned CapEx requirements over next 12-24 months (equipment replacement, facility upgrades)?
6. Are there any pending customer disputes, warranty claims, or legal issues?

**Operational Due Diligence:**
7. What accreditations/certifications does the business hold, and when are renewal dates?
8. How many ASNT Level II/Level III certified technicians do you have, and what are their ages/tenure?
9. What is your average technician billable utilization rate (billable hours / available hours)?
10. Do you use calibration management or field service software? If so, which systems?
11. What is your average customer tenure, and what is annual customer churn rate?
12. Do you have documented SOPs, quality manuals, and training programs that transfer with the business?

**Strategic Fit:**
13. What percentage of your customers are in manufacturing vs. other industries?
14. What is your average service radius, and what % of work is on-site vs. lab-based?
15. Have you seen an increase in new manufacturing customers over the past 2-3 years (reshoring impact)?
16. What complementary services could be offered to your existing customer base (cross-sell potential)?
17. Are there any competitors in your market that you've considered acquiring or partnering with?

**Seller Motivation & Transition:**
18. What is your timeline and motivation for selling? (Retirement, health, burnout, other opportunity?)
19. Are you willing to stay on for 12-24 months post-sale to assist with customer/employee transition?
20. Would you consider seller financing (10-30% of purchase price) to facilitate the transaction?
21. Do any key employees (technicians, salespeople) have expectations of ownership or succession?
22. What do you see as the biggest risks or challenges facing the business over the next 3-5 years?

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- Owner cannot articulate customer retention rate (lack of financial sophistication)
- >30% revenue from single customer (concentration risk)
- Accreditation scope does not match customer needs (upcoming re-assessment could reveal gaps)
- High technician turnover (>25% annually) or recent Level III departures
- Equipment not calibrated within required intervals (compliance failure risk)
- Declining revenue trend (2+ consecutive years) without clear external cause
- Owner unwilling to provide tax returns (potential financial misrepresentation)

### 8.4 Immediate Validation Steps

**Week 1-2: Market Validation**
1. Search BizBuySell for "calibration," "NDT," "inspection," "testing" - analyze 20-30 active listings:
   - Confirm valuation ranges match research (3.5-5.5x SDE)
   - Identify geographic clusters (where are most listings?)
   - Note common business characteristics (revenue, employees, years in business)
2. Pull A2LA directory for target metro area:
   - Count ISO 17025 accredited labs in Dallas (example)
   - Cross-reference with LinkedIn to identify owner demographics (age, background)
   - Shortlist 10-15 potential outreach targets

**Week 3-4: Financial Model Validation**
3. Request financial documentation from 2-3 live business listings (via broker):
   - Validate P&L structure matches research (gross margins 55-65%, EBITDA 30-45%)
   - Analyze revenue mix (recurring vs. project), customer concentration, growth trends
   - Confirm add-backs are reasonable (owner salary, personal expenses, one-time costs)
4. Model acquisition scenarios:
   - $1M revenue, $350k SDE business at 4.5x = $1.575M purchase price
   - SBA 7(a) loan structure: $1.4M loan (90%), $175k down payment (10%)
   - Debt service: $1.4M loan, 8.5% rate, 10-year term = $17,300/month = $207k annually
   - Cash flow coverage: $350k SDE - $207k debt service = $143k owner income (Year 1, pre-growth initiatives)

**Week 5-6: Operational Validation**
5. Conduct informational interviews with 3-5 industry participants:
   - Join ASNT or A2LA as associate member ($200-$500)
   - Attend local chapter meeting or webinar
   - Ask: "What are biggest challenges in calibration/NDT business today?" (validate labor shortage, customer trends)
6. Tour an ISO 17025 lab or NDT facility:
   - Contact owner of non-competitive lab (different metro area) via LinkedIn
   - Request 1-hour facility tour + informational interview
   - Observe: Equipment types/age, workflow efficiency, technician interactions, quality system documentation

**Week 7-8: Financing Validation**
7. Pre-qualify for SBA 7(a) loan:
   - Contact 2-3 SBA preferred lenders (Live Oak Bank, Pinnacle Financial Partners, CDC Small Business Finance)
   - Submit personal financial statement, credit report, business plan outline
   - Confirm eligibility, understand down payment requirements (10-20%), timeline (60-90 days)
8. Network with business attorney and M&A accountant:
   - Interview 2-3 attorneys (focus on SMB acquisitions, asset purchase agreements)
   - Interview 2-3 accountants (focus on quality of earnings, financial due diligence)
   - Understand fee structures (attorney: $10k-$30k, accountant: $8k-$20k for $1-2M deal)

**Month 3: Launch Active Search**
9. Set up deal sourcing infrastructure:
   - Create acquisition criteria one-pager (share with brokers, attorneys, accountants)
   - Build email sequences for direct owner outreach (Mailchimp, HubSpot)
   - Schedule calendar: 5 hours/week on deal sourcing activities (browse listings, cold calls, networking)
10. Make first offer on a practice business listing:
   - Select a lower-priority target (financial risk tolerance, geography not ideal)
   - Submit LOI at conservative valuation (3.5-4.0x SDE)
   - Goal: Learn negotiation process, LOI structure, seller responses (outcome less critical than learning)

**Success Metrics (6-Month Horizon):**
- Deal flow: Review 50+ businesses, submit LOIs on 3-5 targets
- Conversion: Advance to due diligence on 1-2 targets
- Closed transaction: 1 platform acquisition ($1M-$2M revenue) within 12-18 months

## CONCLUSION & INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION

Industrial Support Services represents a **high-conviction SMB acquisition opportunity** within the micro-PE landscape. The convergence of structural tailwinds (manufacturing reshoring, regulatory intensification, demographic-driven seller motivation) and defensive fundamentals (mandated recurring revenue, high switching costs, skilled labor moat) creates a compelling risk-adjusted return profile.

**Key Investment Highlights:**
1. **$25B+ addressable market** across complementary verticals with 5-10% organic growth (7-10% with reshoring tailwind)
2. **Fragmented competitive landscape** (top 5 players <47% share) enabling multi-decade rollup runway
3. **Exceptional unit economics:** 55-75% gross margins, 30-45% EBITDA margins, 10-25:1 LTV:CAC ratios
4. **High barriers to entry** (12-18 month accreditation, $150k+ capital, 1,680+ hour certifications) protect incumbents
5. **Active PE interest** (14.3x median EV/EBITDA) validates exit optionality and multiple expansion strategy
6. **60-85% recurring revenue** from compliance mandates creates recession-resistant cash flows
7. **Labor shortage as moat:** Supply-constrained talent (30% aged 50+, 15% decline in new certs) limits competition

**Target Investment Profile:**
- **Initial Platform:** $1M-$2.5M revenue, ISO 17025 or ASNT accredited, 50-200 customers, 35-45% SDE margin
- **Acquisition Price:** 4.0-5.5x SDE ($1.4M-$3.5M purchase price)
- **Financing:** SBA 7(a) loan (90% LTV), seller note (10%), minimal equity requirement ($150k-$350k)
- **3-Year Target:** Grow to $4M-$6M revenue via organic growth (15-20% CAGR) + 1-2 tuck-in acquisitions
- **Exit Strategy:** Sell to PE platform at 7-8x EBITDA (Year 3-5) or continue rollup to $10M+ revenue (strategic exit at 9-12x)

**Expected Returns:**
- **Base Case:** 5.5x MOIC, 79% IRR (3-year hold)
- **Bear Case:** 3.5x MOIC, 52% IRR (slower growth, lower multiple)
- **Bull Case:** 10.9x MOIC, 128% IRR (aggressive rollup, strategic exit)

**Recommendation:** **BUY - Proceed to active deal sourcing in target geographies (TX, CA, Midwest). Prioritize ISO 17025 calibration labs and ASNT-certified NDT providers with strong recurring revenue (>70%) and owner aged 55+ (motivated seller). Execute phased approach: Platform acquisition (Months 0-12), operational improvement + first tuck-in (Months 13-24), geographic expansion + second tuck-in (Months 25-36).**

The manufacturing reshoring mega-trend creates a generational opportunity to acquire cash-flowing, recession-resistant businesses at SMB valuations (3.5-5.5x) and position for strategic exit at platform multiples (7-10x). The combination of operational leverage, acquisition synergies, and multiple arbitrage creates a pathway to exceptional risk-adjusted returns in a defensible, growing end-market.
