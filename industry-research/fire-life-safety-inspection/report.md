## Executive Summary

Fire/Life Safety Inspection represents a compelling "dirty, essential" SMB acquisition opportunity with **double moat protection**: (1) specialized equipment capital requirements and (2) mandatory licensing/certifications. This sector benefits from NFPA-mandated recurring inspections across three core service lines—fire extinguishers (NFPA 10), sprinkler systems (NFPA 25), and fire alarms (NFPA 72)—creating predictable, compliance-driven revenue streams.

### Investment Thesis Alignment

**Strengths:**
- **Regulatory moat:** NFPA codes mandate annual/quarterly inspections for all commercial buildings
- **Equipment moat:** $40,000-$100,000 startup costs for testing equipment and vehicles create meaningful barriers
- **Certification moat:** NICET certification requires 6 months to 5+ years depending on level, deterring competition
- **Recurring revenue:** 40%+ recurring revenue commands 6x-8x EBITDA multiples vs. 4x-5x for project work
- **Route density economics:** Bundled services (extinguisher + sprinkler + alarm) can increase revenue per stop by 3-4x
- **Young-people deterrence:** Physical, dirty work in mechanical rooms with process-driven compliance documentation
- **Strong 1+1=3 rollup potential:** Consolidate routes, share overhead, achieve 20-40% EBITDA margins

**Risks:**
- **Technician labor shortage:** NICET-certified techs earn $41,000-$66,000; retention requires competitive pay
- **Customer concentration:** 25%+ revenue from top 5 customers creates vulnerability
- **Insurance costs:** Subrogation claims (water damage) drive higher premiums than general contractors
- **Inspection vs. installation confusion:** Must avoid project-heavy businesses; focus on recurring ITM (Inspection, Testing, Maintenance)
- **Licensing complexity:** California C-16 license requires 4 years experience, $590 in fees, bonding, and insurance

- **Capital intensity:** High (inventory, fabrication equipment, larger vehicles)
- **Customer acquisition:** Constant bidding, project-by-project

**Mixed Model (EVALUATE CAREFULLY):**
- Many businesses offer both inspection and installation
- **Ideal ratio:** 50%+ recurring inspection revenue
- **Leverage inspection for repair/upgrade sales:** Inspections identify deficiencies, leading to repair/installation work at higher margins
- **APi Group flywheel:** Every $1 of inspection revenue generates $3-$4 in service revenue at 10% higher gross margin
- **Risk:** Don't overpay for project pipeline; value recurring contracts only

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1. What percentage of revenue is recurring inspection contracts vs. project installation?
2. Are inspection contracts annual agreements or one-off jobs?
3. Does the business bid on new construction projects or focus on existing building maintenance?
4. What is the customer retention rate for inspection customers?
5. How much inventory is tied up in parts/equipment for installation work?

**Recommendation:** Target businesses with 60%+ recurring ITM revenue. If buying a mixed business at $75K-$200K, discount project revenue by 50% in valuation calculation and focus growth strategy on converting one-time customers to annual inspection contracts.

- Mix: 40% small, 50% medium, 10% large
- Geographic density within 25-mile radius
- Multi-year contracts (2-3 years) for stability

### 5.2 Bundled Service Economics - CRITICAL VALUE DRIVER

**Single-Service Model (Less Attractive):**

*Fire Extinguisher Only:*
- Average building: 10 extinguishers
- Annual inspection: $250 (10 @ $25/ea)
- Tech visit time: 30-45 minutes
- Revenue per visit: $250
- Profit margin: ~30% = $75 profit

**Bundled Service Model (PREFERRED):**

*Fire Extinguisher + Sprinkler + Alarm:*
- Average building: 10 extinguishers, 1 sprinkler system, 1 alarm system
- Annual inspection bundle: $2,500
  - Extinguishers: $250
  - Sprinkler quarterly checks + annual: $1,500
  - Alarm annual inspection: $750
- Tech visit time: 3-4 visits @ 2 hours each = 6-8 hours total
- Revenue per customer: $2,500 (10x single service)
- Profit margin: ~35% = $875 profit (vs. $75 for extinguisher-only)

**Revenue Lift Analysis:**

| Metric | Extinguisher Only | Full Bundle | Lift |
|--------|------------------|-------------|------|
| Avg Contract Value | $250 | $2,500 | **10x** |
| Annual Visits | 1 | 3-4 | 3-4x |
| Total Tech Time | 0.75 hrs | 6-8 hrs | 8-10x |
| Gross Profit/Customer | $75 | $875 | **11.7x** |
| Churn Rate | 8-10% | 3-5% | 50% lower |

**Economies of Bundling:**
- **Trip charge absorption:** Same $59.50 base visit fee covers multiple services
- **Customer acquisition cost spread:** Same marketing/sales cost generates 10x revenue
- **Cross-training efficiency:** One tech with multiple certifications = lower labor cost
- **Customer retention:** Harder to switch providers when they handle all fire safety
- **Upsell opportunity:** Inspection reveals deficiencies → repair/upgrade work at 40%+ margins

**APi Group Data Point:**
- "Every $1 of inspection revenue generates $3-$4 in additional service revenue at a 10% higher gross margin"
- Inspection-first model creates flywheel of recurring inspection + deficiency repair

**Bundled Service Market Evidence:**
- Guardian Fire Services: "One visit can cover multiple inspections—sprinklers, alarms, extinguishers, even backflow testing—reducing trip charges and operational disruptions"
- Pye-Barker positioning: "One-stop shop" for facility managers
- Customer preference: Single vendor for all fire safety = one invoice, one point of contact, simplified compliance

**Strategic Implication for $75K-$200K Acquisitions:**
- **Target businesses with bundled capability** (40% premium)
- **Or acquire single-service business with intent to add services** (organic growth opportunity)
- **Cross-train existing techs:** NICET ITFAS (fire alarm inspection) + ITWBS (sprinkler inspection) = 2-3 year project
- **Partner with specialists:** Subcontract services not offered in-house while building capability

### 5.3 Customer Acquisition & Retention

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- Referrals/word-of-mouth: $0-$200 (existing business advantage)
- Online marketing (SEO/Google Ads): $300-$800 per customer
- Direct mail/cold outreach: $200-$500 per customer
- Industry trade shows: $500-$1,500 per customer
- Property management company partnerships: Low CAC, high volume

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):**
- Average contract: $2,000/year
- Average retention: 8 years (mandate-driven)
- Gross margin: 35%
- CLV = $2,000 × 0.35 × 8 years = **$5,600**

**CAC to CLV Ratio:**
- $500 CAC / $5,600 CLV = **11.2x** (excellent; >3x is considered good)

**Retention Drivers:**
- **Regulatory mandate:** Can't skip inspections (insurance/code requirements)
- **Switching costs:** New provider must re-learn building systems
- **Annual contracts:** Auto-renewal common
- **Relationship with property managers:** Sticky once approved vendor
- **Documentation history:** Years of inspection records create lock-in

**Churn Reduction Tactics:**
- Automated inspection reminders (reduce lapses)
- Multi-year contracts with fixed pricing
- Online portals for compliance documentation access
- Proactive deficiency identification (value-add beyond compliance)
- Customer-specific pricing for high-volume customers

## 7. Roll-Up Strategy - "1+1=3" Value Creation

### 7.1 Consolidation Thesis

**Why Fire/Life Safety Is Attractive for Roll-Ups:**

1. **Fragmentation:** Thousands of small operators ripe for consolidation
2. **Recurring revenue:** SaaS-like characteristics (40%+ recurring = premium multiples)
3. **Regulatory mandate:** Demand is non-discretionary
4. **Scalable operations:** Route-based, systemizable processes
5. **Synergy potential:** Overhead consolidation, cross-selling, route optimization
6. **Exit market:** PE platforms (APi, Pye-Barker) actively acquiring at premium multiples

**Active Consolidators (Reference for Exit Strategy):**
- **APi Group:** 0.9x revenue for tuck-ins, 5-9x EBITDA
- **Pye-Barker:** 150+ acquisitions, all but 4 states covered
- **Guardian Fire:** 12 acquisitions since 2022
- **Sciens Building Solutions:** PE-backed platform

### 7.2 "1+1=3" Synergy Model

**Example: Acquiring Two $150K EBITDA Fire Inspection Businesses**

- **Total Cost Savings: $100K**

**Combined EBITDA:**
- Business A: $150K
- Business B: $150K
- Revenue synergies: +$52K (35% margin on $150K new revenue)
- Cost synergies: +$100K
- **New EBITDA: $452K** (vs. $300K standalone = **+50% increase**)

**Valuation Arbitrage:**

| Scenario | Revenue | EBITDA | Multiple | Enterprise Value |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Business A (standalone)** | $500K | $150K | 4.0x | $600K |
| **Business B (standalone)** | $500K | $150K | 4.0x | $600K |
| **Total Paid** | | | | **$1,200K** |
| | | | | |
| **Combined Platform** | $1,150K | $452K | 6.5x | **$2,938K** |
| **Value Created** | | | | **+$1,738K** |
| **Return on Investment** | | | | **145% gain** |

**Time to Realize:** 18-24 months post-acquisition for full integration

### 7.3 Roll-Up Execution Roadmap

**Phase 1: Platform Acquisition (Year 0)**

*Target:*
- $75K-$150K SDE business
- Manager-run (owner working ON business, not IN business)
- 40%+ recurring revenue
- Clean financials, established customers
- Bundled services or capability to add services

*Acquisition Criteria:*
- 3.5-4.0x SDE multiple ($75K SDE = $262K-$300K purchase price)
- Seller financing: 20-30% ($50K-$90K seller note)
- SBA 7(a) loan: 70-80% ($180K-$240K financed)
- Down payment: $32K-$60K from buyer

*Integration Actions (Months 1-6):*
1. Implement field service management software (Uptick or Inspect Point)
2. Document all processes (inspection procedures, pricing, routing)
3. Identify cross-sell opportunities (customers missing services)
4. Optimize routes using software (15% efficiency gain)
5. Hire/train for growth (add 1 tech if at capacity)

**Phase 2: Tuck-In Acquisition #1 (Year 1)**

*Target:*
- $50K-$100K SDE
- Same geographic market (overlap or adjacent territory)
- Complementary services (if Platform does extinguishers, Target does sprinklers)
- Willing to stay on as employee (tech or sales)

*Acquisition Structure:*
- 3.0-3.5x SDE (lower multiple for tuck-in)
- $50K SDE = $150K-$175K purchase price
- Owner stays as employee (salary + earn-out)
- Financing: Cash flow from Platform + small seller note

*Integration (Months 1-3):*
1. Migrate customers to Platform software
2. Consolidate office/admin immediately
3. Cross-train techs on complementary services
4. Re-route for geographic efficiency
5. Rebrand to Platform name

**Phase 3: Tuck-In Acquisition #2 (Year 2)**

*Repeat Phase 2 model*
- Expand geographic footprint or densify existing territory
- Add specialized capability (e.g., industrial fire protection)

**Phase 4: Exit (Year 3-5)**

*Exit Options:*

**Option A: Sell to Regional Platform**
- Target buyers: APi Group regional branches, Pye-Barker, local PE-backed platforms
- Valuation: 6-8x EBITDA (if 40%+ recurring revenue)
- Example: $500K EBITDA × 7x = $3.5M enterprise value

**Option B: Sell to Strategic Buyer**
- Larger fire protection company wants your territory
- Valuation: 5-7x EBITDA
- May include employment contract/earn-out

**Option C: Recapitalize with PE**
- PE firm takes majority stake, you retain 20-30%
- Continue as CEO with equity upside
- Platform for further acquisitions

**Financial Model Example:**

*Initial Investment (Year 0):*
- Platform acquisition: $300K (3.5x $85K SDE)
- Down payment: $60K
- SBA loan: $240K @ 8% = $2,800/month payment

*Roll-Up Execution (Years 1-3):*
- Tuck-in #1 (Year 1): $175K
- Tuck-in #2 (Year 2): $150K
- Total invested: $625K

*Exit (Year 4):*
- Combined EBITDA: $450K (organic + acquired + synergies)
- Exit multiple: 7x
- Enterprise value: $3,150K
- SBA loan payoff: -$180K (after 4 years payments)
- Tuck-in notes payoff: -$50K
- **Net proceeds: $2,920K**

*Return Calculation:*
- Cash invested: $60K down + $175K tuck-in #1 + $150K tuck-in #2 = $385K
- Net proceeds: $2,920K
- **Return: 7.6x cash-on-cash in 4 years**
- **IRR: ~66% annually**

### 7.4 Roll-Up Risks & Mitigation

**Risk #1: Integration Complexity**
- *Mitigation:* Standardize on single software platform immediately; document processes in detail; retain key employees from acquired businesses

**Risk #2: Customer Churn Post-Acquisition**
- *Mitigation:* Maintain service quality; communicate acquisition as positive (more services, better technology); lock in multi-year contracts pre-acquisition

**Risk #3: Tech Retention**
- *Mitigation:* Competitive pay + benefits; NICET certification reimbursement; career path (tech → lead tech → operations manager)

**Risk #4: Overpaying for Tuck-Ins**
- *Mitigation:* Disciplined valuation (3.0-3.5x SDE for tuck-ins); walk away if synergies not clear; focus on recurring revenue, not project pipelines

**Risk #5: Geographic Over-Extension**
- *Mitigation:* Stay within 50-mile radius until reaching $2M+ revenue; route density > geographic coverage

**Risk #6: Exit Market Dries Up**
- *Mitigation:* Build business with strong fundamentals (40%+ recurring, <5% churn, tech-enabled); PE interest in fire protection remains strong through 2026

- Deficiency identification (builds trust + repair revenue)
- Customer signature required (proof of service)
- Peer review of inspection reports (monthly sample audit)

**Risk Management:**

**Liability Exposure:**
1. **Missed deficiency:** Inspector fails to identify fire safety issue → fire occurs → subrogation claim
2. **Equipment failure:** Improper hydrostatic testing → extinguisher fails in emergency
3. **Water damage:** Sprinkler testing causes leak → property damage
4. **False reporting:** Inspector falsifies inspection records → regulatory violation + lawsuit

**Insurance Requirements:**

| Coverage Type | Typical Limits | Annual Premium | Purpose |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **General Liability** | $1M-$2M | $1,500-$3,000 | Bodily injury, property damage |
| **Professional Liability (E&O)** | $1M-$2M | $2,000-$5,000 | Inspection errors, omissions |
| **Workers' Compensation** | Statutory | $3,000-$8,000 | Employee injuries |
| **Commercial Auto** | $1M | $2,000-$5,000 | Vehicle accidents |
| **Umbrella Policy** | $2M-$5M | $1,000-$2,000 | Excess liability |

**Total Annual Insurance: $9,500-$23,000** (2-5% of revenue for small businesses)

**Claims Experience:**
- Leading cause: Subrogation for water damage (often unfounded but require defense)
- Fire sprinkler contractors see higher claims frequency/severity
- Best defense: Meticulous documentation, adherence to NFPA standards

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Maintain comprehensive records (photos, timestamps, GPS)
2. Annual NICET continuing education (90 hours/3 years)
3. Peer review and quality audits
4. Clear communication with customers (deficiency reports)
5. Adequate insurance coverage (don't underinsure)

### 9.3 Valuation Methodologies

**SDE Multiple Method (For businesses <$1M revenue, owner-operated):**

**Formula:** Business Value = SDE × Multiple

**Multiples by Business Characteristics:**

| Business Profile | SDE Multiple | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Pure installation, project-based** | 2.5-3.0x | Lumpy cash flow, high buyer risk |
| **Mixed installation + inspection** | 3.0-3.5x | Some recurring, but execution risk |
| **50%+ recurring inspection revenue** | 3.5-4.5x | Predictable cash flow, lower risk |
| **Manager-run, systems-driven** | 4.0-5.0x | Less owner-dependent |
| **Bundled services, high retention** | 4.5-5.5x | Premium for service breadth |

**Example Valuation ($500K revenue, $210K SDE, 60% recurring):**
- SDE Multiple: 4.0x (recurring revenue premium)
- **Business Value: $840,000**

**EBITDA Multiple Method (For businesses >$1M revenue, manager-run):**

**Formula:** Enterprise Value = EBITDA × Multiple

**Multiples by Business Characteristics:**

| Business Profile | EBITDA Multiple | ARR/MRR Component | Total Valuation |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **<$500K EBITDA, <40% recurring** | 4-5x | - | Base multiple |
| **$500K-$1M EBITDA, 40-50% recurring** | 5-6x | +2-3x ARR | Premium for scale |
| **$1M+ EBITDA, 50%+ recurring** | 6-8x | +2-3.5x ARR | Strategic buyer interest |
| **$2M+ EBITDA, national footprint** | 8-10x | +3-4x ARR | PE platform valuation |

**Recurring Revenue Component Valuation:**
- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):** 2.0-3.5x multiple
  - Example: $300K in annual inspection contracts × 2.5x = $750K value
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** 35-45x multiple
  - Example: $10K/month monitoring contracts × 40x = $400K value

**Example: $1M Revenue, $350K EBITDA, 60% Recurring:**
- Recurring revenue: $600K
- Non-recurring: $400K
- EBITDA multiple: 6.5x (scale + recurring premium)
- ARR multiple: 2.5x
- **Valuation Calculation:**
  - Base (EBITDA): $350K × 6.5x = $2,275K
  - OR
  - Recurring component: $600K × 2.5x = $1,500K
  - Non-recurring component: $400K × 2.0x = $800K
  - **Enterprise Value: $2,275K - $2,300K**

## 10. Investment Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### 10.1 Critical Risks (Ranked by Severity)

**Risk #1: Technician Labor Shortage (HIGH)**

*Description:*
- NICET-certified techs earn $45K-$75K; competitive labor market
- Training takes 6 months to 5 years for full certification
- Competitors poach trained techs
- Small businesses struggle to offer competitive benefits

*Impact:*
- Revenue growth constrained by available techs
- Wage inflation erodes margins
- Customer service quality declines if understaffed

*Mitigation:*
- Pay top-quartile wages ($53K+ for Level II techs)
- Provide clear career path (tech → lead → operations manager)
- Company-funded NICET certification and continuing education
- Build apprenticeship pipeline (high school partnerships)
- Retain key techs through seller transition (offer raises/bonuses)

**Risk #2: Customer Concentration (HIGH)**

*Description:*
- If top 5 customers = 25%+ of revenue, loss of one customer is significant
- Property management companies may consolidate vendors
- Large customers have pricing leverage

*Impact:*
- Sudden revenue loss if key customer churns
- Margin pressure from large customer negotiations
- Business valuation discount (buyers fear concentration risk)

*Mitigation:*
- Target businesses with diversified customer base (<10% from any one customer)
- Add new customers aggressively (target 20-30 new annually)
- Multi-year contracts with key accounts
- Exceptional service to maintain "sticky" relationships

**Risk #3: Licensing & Certification Dependency (MEDIUM-HIGH)**

*Description:*
- C-16 license tied to Responsible Managing Employee (RME)
- If RME leaves, license lapses → can't perform work
- NICET certifications personal to techs (not transferable)

*Impact:*
- Business cannot operate without licensed individual
- Emergency if RME quits or dies
- Acquisition could fall apart if licensing not secured

*Mitigation:*
- Due diligence: Verify C-16 license status and RME commitment
- Transition plan: Seller stays 6-12 months OR hire licensed manager pre-close
- Redundancy: Multiple employees with C-16 qualifications
- Licensing contingency in purchase agreement

**Risk #4: Insurance Cost & Availability (MEDIUM)**

*Description:*
- Fire protection industry sees higher claims frequency (subrogation for water damage)
- Some carriers exiting market (e.g., Colony insurance)
- Premium increases 10-20% annually in hard markets

*Impact:*
- Insurance costs rise from $15K/year to $20K-$30K+
- Margins compressed by 2-4%
- Some businesses uninsurable if claims history poor

*Mitigation:*
- Due diligence: Review 5 years of claims history
- Obtain insurance quotes pre-close (ensure insurability)
- Safety protocols: Meticulous documentation, NFPA adherence
- Shop multiple carriers annually
- Self-insure small claims (higher deductibles)

**Risk #5: Regulatory Changes (LOW-MEDIUM)**

*Description:*
- NFPA standards updated every 3-5 years
- California could change C-16 license requirements
- IoT/smart building technology could reduce inspection frequency

*Impact:*
- New equipment or training required (capital outlay)
- Inspection intervals might lengthen (revenue per customer declines)
- Compliance costs increase

*Mitigation:*
- Stay active in NFPA/industry associations
- Budget for continuing education and equipment upgrades
- Diversify revenue (add services like monitoring or smart systems)
- Regulatory moat is strong; major changes unlikely in 5-10 year timeframe

**Risk #6: Economic Downturn Impact (LOW-MEDIUM)**

*Description:*
- Recession could slow new construction (hurts installation-heavy businesses)
- Small businesses might delay "optional" inspections (though required by law)
- Commercial real estate vacancy reduces customer base

*Impact:*
- Revenue growth slows or reverses
- Margin pressure from price competition
- Customer churn increases (businesses closing)

*Mitigation:*
- Focus on recurring inspection contracts (non-discretionary)
- Avoid project-based installation work (more cyclical)
- Diversify customer segments (not just one industry)
- Maintain strong cash reserves (6 months operating expenses)

**Risk #7: Technology Disruption (LOW, Long-Term)**

*Description:*
- IoT sensors could provide real-time monitoring of fire protection systems
- AI/automation could reduce need for manual inspections
- Smart buildings integrate fire safety into building management systems

*Impact:*
- Inspection frequency declines (annual → less frequent)
- Revenue per customer shrinks
- Businesses that don't adopt technology become obsolete

*Mitigation:*
- Embrace technology (offer IoT monitoring as upsell)
- Position as "technology-enabled inspection company"
- Annual physical inspections likely required by insurance/codes for foreseeable future
- 10-15 year horizon for major disruption (low immediate risk)

### 11.5 Final Recommendation: GO

**Investment Thesis: STRONG**

Fire/Life Safety Inspection aligns exceptionally well with Holt Ventures' "dirty, essential" investment criteria:

**Strengths (Green Lights):**
1. Double moat: Equipment ($40K-$100K) + Licensing (NICET, C-16)
2. Recurring revenue: 50%+ recurring commands 6-8x EBITDA multiples
3. Regulatory mandate: NFPA codes create non-discretionary demand
4. Young-people deterrence: Physical, dirty work in mechanical rooms; process-driven compliance
5. Strong unit economics: 35-45% gross margins, 20-40% EBITDA margins
6. Roll-up potential: Fragmented market, 1+1=3 synergies validated by APi/Pye-Barker success
7. Exit market: Active PE and strategic buyers paying premium multiples

**Risks (Manageable):**
1. Technician labor shortage → Mitigate with competitive pay, career path, training
2. Customer concentration → Target diversified customer base (<10% per customer)
3. Licensing dependency → Verify C-16/NICET in due diligence, retain key employees
4. Insurance costs → Review claims history, obtain quotes pre-close

**Target Deal Profile:**
- Purchase Price: $300K-$400K (4.0x SDE on $75K-$100K SDE business)
- Down Payment: $30K-$60K (10-15%)
- SBA 7(a) Loan: $270K-$340K
- DSCR: 1.5-2.0x (comfortable debt coverage)
- Hold Period: 3-5 years
- Exit Strategy: Sell to regional platform (APi, Pye-Barker) at 6-8x EBITDA

**Expected Returns:**
- Base Case (Hold & Operate): 10-15x cash-on-cash, 50-70% IRR
- Growth Case (Add Services + Tuck-In): 12-18x cash-on-cash, 80-110% IRR
- Roll-Up Case (3 Acquisitions): 7-10x cash-on-cash, 60-75% IRR

**Action Items:**
1. Begin search on BizBuySell (filter: fire protection, $200K-$500K asking price, California)
2. Direct outreach to 20 local operators (personalized letters)
3. Build relationships with 2-3 business brokers
4. Shadow a fire protection business owner for a day (learn operations firsthand)
5. Obtain pre-approval for SBA 7(a) loan ($500K-$1M)
6. Interview 3-5 FSM software providers (Uptick, Inspect Point, ServiceTrade)

**Timeline to First Acquisition:**
- Months 1-3: Search and evaluate 10-20 opportunities
- Months 4-6: Deep due diligence on 2-3 finalists
- Months 7-9: LOI, purchase agreement, SBA loan approval
- Month 10: Close and begin transition

**Probability of Success: HIGH (75-85%)**
- Market fundamentals strong (regulatory mandate, fragmentation)
- Proven roll-up model (APi, Pye-Barker success)
- Andy's systems-builder skillset aligns with operational leverage opportunities
- Exit market active with premium valuations
