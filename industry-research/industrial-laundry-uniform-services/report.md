## 4. ROUTE ECONOMICS & DENSITY LEVERAGE

### 4.1 Route-Based Business Model

**Fundamental Economics Similar to Waste/Medical Waste:**

The industrial laundry business operates on **route density economics** where profitability scales dramatically with stops per route per day:

**Cost Structure by Route:**
- **Driver salary**: $20-25/hour × 8 hours = $160-200/day
- **Vehicle**: $40-60/day (depreciation, fuel, maintenance, insurance)
- **Total route cost**: $200-260/day

**Revenue Per Stop Math:**
- **Small customer**: $50-150/week = $10-30/stop (2x weekly) or $50-150/stop (weekly)
- **Medium customer**: $150-400/week = $150-400/stop
- **Large customer**: $400-1,500/week = $400-1,500/stop

**Breakeven Analysis:**
- **10 stops/day**: $260 cost ÷ 10 = $26/stop breakeven
- **15 stops/day**: $260 cost ÷ 15 = $17.33/stop breakeven
- **20 stops/day**: $260 cost ÷ 20 = $13/stop breakeven

**Profitability by Route Density:**
- **Sparse route (10 stops @ $100 avg)**: $1,000 revenue - $260 cost = $740 profit/day = 74% margin
- **Dense route (15 stops @ $100 avg)**: $1,500 revenue - $260 cost = $1,240 profit/day = 83% margin
- **Optimal route (20 stops @ $100 avg)**: $2,000 revenue - $260 cost = $1,740 profit/day = 87% margin

**Key Insight:** Every additional stop per route day improves profitability by $70-100 with minimal marginal cost.

### 4.2 Geographic Density & Route Optimization

**Route Density Metrics:**

**Stops per mile:**
- **Sparse (rural/suburban)**: 1-2 stops/mile = 40-80 miles/route
- **Medium (urban/industrial parks)**: 3-5 stops/mile = 12-25 miles/route
- **Dense (downtown/concentrated)**: 6-10 stops/mile = 6-12 miles/route

**Stops per hour:**
- **Average**: 1.5-2.5 stops/hour (including drive time, handling, paperwork)
- **Best-in-class**: 2.5-3.5 stops/hour with optimization

**Time per stop breakdown:**
- Drive time between stops: 10-15 minutes
- Unload clean laundry: 5-10 minutes
- Load soiled laundry: 5-10 minutes

This section quantifies Andy's thesis that "systems wins" create massive leverage in industrial laundry operations. Four key systems areas offer 15-30% combined EBITDA margin improvement.

### 5.1 Scheduling Optimization (Target: 5-8% Margin Improvement)

**Current State Inefficiencies:**
- Manual route planning using spreadsheets
- No consideration of traffic patterns, time windows
- Reactive scheduling (customer calls requesting changes)
- Unbalanced routes (some drivers finish at 2pm, others at 6pm)
- Emergency pickups disrupt entire day

**Andy's Systems Solution:**

**Route Optimization Software Implementation:**
- **Phase 1 (Month 1-2)**: Implement Route4Me or OptimoRoute ($100/month)
- **Phase 2 (Month 3-4)**: Input all customer addresses, service frequencies, time windows
- **Phase 3 (Month 5-6)**: Analyze historical data, optimize sequences
- **Phase 4 (Month 7+)**: Dynamic daily optimization based on demand fluctuations

**Key Optimization Features:**
1. **Multi-stop optimization**: Best sequence for 12-20 stops considering all constraints
2. **Traffic awareness**: Real-time traffic data adjusts routes
3. **Time windows**: Respect customer preferences (pickup before 10am, etc.)
4. **Driver skills**: Assign routes to drivers based on customer relationships
5. **Vehicle capacity**: Ensure truck capacity not exceeded
6. **Balanced workload**: Distribute stops evenly across drivers

**Quantified Benefits:**

**Metric: Stops Per Route Day**
- Baseline: 12 stops/day
- Target: 14 stops/day (+17%)
- Mechanism: Reduce backtracking, optimize sequence, compress drive time

**Metric: Miles Per Stop**
- Baseline: 4 miles/stop (48 miles/day)
- Target: 3 miles/stop (42 miles/day)
- Savings: 6 miles × 250 days × $1/mile = $1,500/year/route

**Metric: Route Completion Time**
- Baseline: 8.5 hours (30 min overtime daily)
- Target: 8.0 hours (no overtime)
- Savings: 0.5 hr × 250 days × $30/hr overtime = $3,750/year/route

**Total Scheduling Optimization Impact (2-route operation):**
- Incremental stops: 4 stops/day × 2 routes × 250 days = 2,000 stops/year
- Revenue: 2,000 stops × $100 = $200,000/year (but need processing capacity)
- More realistic: Fill existing capacity better = $40-60k additional revenue
- Fuel savings: $3,000/year
- Overtime savings: $7,500/year
- **Total impact: $50-70k EBITDA improvement = 5-7% margin gain on $1M revenue base**

**Implementation Difficulty: 3/10** (Low)
- SaaS tools are user-friendly
- 20-40 hours initial setup
- 2-3 hours/week ongoing management
- Drivers adapt quickly with training

### 5.2 Throughput Maximization (Target: 8-12% Margin Improvement)

**Key Metric: Pounds Per Operating Hour (PPOH)**

Industry standard: 120 PPOH for commercial laundries
Best-in-class: 180-220 PPOH with optimization
Tunnel washers: 2,000-6,000 PPOH (high-volume operations)

**Throughput Bottleneck Analysis:**

For typical small industrial laundry processing 10,000 lbs/week:

**Washing (Often NOT the bottleneck):**
- Equipment: 2-3 industrial washers (50-75 lb capacity each)
- Cycle time: 30-45 minutes
- Throughput: 100-150 lbs/hour per machine = 200-450 lbs/hr total
- Daily capacity: 1,600-3,600 lbs/day (8-hour operation)

**Drying (Potential bottleneck):**
- Equipment: 2-3 industrial dryers (50-75 lb capacity)
- Cycle time: 45-60 minutes (longer than washing!)
- Throughput: 60-100 lbs/hour per machine = 120-300 lbs/hr total
- **Problem**: Dryers often rate-limiting step

**Pressing/Finishing (Common bottleneck):**
- Equipment: 1-2 pressing stations
- Labor-intensive: Manual pressing of shirts, pants
- Throughput: 30-50 pieces/hour = 20-30 lbs/hour per person
- **Major bottleneck**: Can only press 160-240 lbs/day per person

**Folding (Potential bottleneck):**
- Equipment: Folding tables, manual labor
- Throughput: 50-80 pieces/hour per person
- Automated folders: 800+ pieces/hour (but $30-50k investment)

**Andy's Throughput Optimization Strategy:**

**1. Identify True Bottleneck (Week 1-2):**
- Track PPOH at each stage for 2 weeks
- Calculate: Lbs processed ÷ operating hours at each station
- Typical finding: Pressing/finishing is 50-70% slower than washing/drying

**2. Eliminate Bottleneck (Priority Order):**

**Option A: Reduce Pressing Requirements (Low Cost)**
- Shift customer mix toward items not requiring pressing (towels, scrubs, aprons)
- Negotiate "no-iron" alternatives with customers
- Impact: 20-30% reduction in pressing hours
- Cost: $0 (customer education)

**Option B: Add Pressing Capacity (Medium Cost)**
- Hire part-time presser ($15/hr, 4 hours/day)
- Cost: $15,600/year
- Capacity gain: 640-960 lbs/week additional pressing
- Revenue potential: $12,800-19,200/year (@ $20/lb revenue equivalent)
- **ROI: 82-123%** ✓ Profitable

**Option C: Automated Finishing Equipment (High Cost, Not Recommended Initially)**
- Automated shirt presser: $15-30k
- Automated towel folder: $30-50k
- Only viable at higher volumes (20,000+ lbs/week)
- Defer until Year 2-3

**3. Optimize Workflow & Scheduling:**

**Problem**: Uneven arrival of soiled laundry creates peaks/valleys
- Monday morning: 2,500 lbs arrive (weekend pickup backlog)
- Wednesday afternoon: 800 lbs (light day)
- Result: Monday overtime, Wednesday idle time

**Solution**: Smooth workflow through pickup schedule adjustment
- Shift some Monday pickups to Saturday route (part-time driver)
- Incentivize customers with flexible schedules to choose Tuesday/Thursday
- Pre-sort incoming laundry immediately (Monday AM sort crew)
- Result: Even 2,000 lbs/day flow vs. 2,500/1,200/1,800/2,000/1,500 spiky pattern

**Impact**:
- Eliminate Monday overtime: $3,000-5,000/year savings
- Increase average utilization: 70% → 85% capacity usage
- Serve more customers without equipment investment

**4. Reduce Changeover Time:**

**Problem**: Switching between customer batches wastes time
- Drain previous customer's items
- Clean equipment
- Set up next customer's items
- 10-15 minutes per changeover × 20 changeovers/day = 3-5 hours lost

**Solution**: Batch processing by item type (not by customer)
- Wash all shop towels together (Mon/Thu)
- Wash all uniforms together (Tue/Wed/Fri)
- Sort by customer AFTER processing
- Requires robust tracking system (RFID or barcodes)

**Impact**:
- Reduce changeovers: 20/day → 5/day
- Time savings: 2.5-4 hours/day
- Capacity gain: 300-480 lbs/day = 1,500-2,400 lbs/week
- Revenue potential: $30-48k/year

**Quantified Throughput Impact:**

**Baseline Operation:**
- PPOH: 110 (below industry average)
- Operating hours: 8 hours/day × 5 days = 40 hrs/week
- Weekly throughput: 4,400 lbs/week
- Revenue: $220,000/year (@ $50/lb annual revenue equivalent)

**After Andy's Optimization:**
- PPOH: 145 (+32% improvement)
- Operating hours: 8 hours/day × 5 days = 40 hrs/week
- Weekly throughput: 5,800 lbs/week (+1,400 lbs)
- Revenue: $290,000/year (+$70k)
- Incremental labor cost: $15,600 (part-time presser)
- Incremental processing costs: $15,000 (utilities, chemicals)
- **Net EBITDA improvement: $39,400 = 8% margin gain on $500k base**

**Implementation Difficulty: 5/10** (Medium)
- Requires process analysis and workflow redesign
- Staff training on new procedures
- 40-60 hours initial analysis and implementation
- 3-6 months to fully optimize
- Risk: Customer items mixed up during batch processing (mitigated by RFID)

**Andy's Cost Control Strategy:**

**1. Labor Optimization (Largest Opportunity: 5-8% margin improvement)**

**Current inefficiencies:**
- Overstaffing during slow periods
- Overtime during peak periods
- High turnover = constant training costs
- Inefficient task allocation

**Solutions:**

**A. Flexible Staffing Model**
- **Core full-time team**: 2-3 employees (processing lead, driver)
- **Part-time flex team**: 2-3 employees (15-25 hrs/week for peak days)
- **Impact**: Match labor to demand, reduce overtime 80-90%

**Example 2-Route Operation:**
- Baseline: 4 FT employees × $35k = $140k + 10% overtime = $154k
- Optimized: 2 FT ($70k) + 3 PT ($15k each = $45k) = $115k, minimal overtime
- **Savings: $39,000/year**

**B. Cross-Training**
- Problem: Specialists create bottlenecks ("only Jane knows how to run the boiler")
- Solution: Cross-train all staff on multiple stations
- Impact: Flexibility when absent, prevent bottlenecks, higher PPOH
- Training investment: 20 hours per employee = $600/employee
- **ROI: 6,500%** (assuming $39k savings)

**C. Performance-Based Incentives**
- **Metric**: PPOH (pounds per operator hour)
- **Baseline target**: 120 PPOH
- **Bonus structure**: $0.50/hour bonus for every 10 PPOH above 120
- Example: Team achieves 140 PPOH = $1/hr bonus = $2,000/year per employee
- **Impact**: Increased productivity, reduced supervision needs, lower turnover
- **Net savings**: Productivity gains exceed bonus costs (15% productivity = 6% bonus cost)

**2. Chemical Cost Optimization (Target: 1-2% margin improvement)**

Industrial laundry operators face constant inventory challenges:
- **Lost items**: 2-5% annual loss rate (customers don't return uniforms)
- **Misdelivery**: Items go to wrong customer (mix-ups during sorting)
- **Billing disputes**: "We only received 8 uniforms, you charged for 11"
- **Manual counting**: 15-30 min per customer per week (labor intensive)
- **Customer satisfaction**: Employees missing uniforms = angry customers

**Cost of Manual Tracking:**

50 customers × 20 min counting/week = 1,000 min/week = 17 hrs/week = $15,300/year labor
Lost uniforms: 500 total uniforms × 3% loss = 15/year × $40 replacement = $600/year
Billing disputes: 2 hrs/week customer service = $3,120/year
**Total cost: $19,020/year**

**RFID Tracking Solution:**

**Technology:**

- Sunday afternoon: 5-6 hours strategic work (financial review, systems development, planning)

**Key Enablers for Part-Time Success:**

**1. Dashboard & KPI Monitoring**
- Real-time visibility into operations without being on-site
- Metrics tracked: Daily revenue, stops per route, PPOH, equipment downtime, customer issues
- Alerts for exceptions (route running late, equipment down, customer complaint)
- **Andy builds this (10-15 hrs) to enable remote management**

**2. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**
- Documented processes for all routine operations
- Facility manager can reference SOPs vs. calling Andy
- New employee training via SOPs = less Andy time
- **Andy creates these Month 1-3 (20-30 hrs total investment)**

**3. Daily Sync Rituals**
- 15-min morning call with facility manager (blockers, priorities)
- End-of-day email summary from manager (stats, issues, wins)
- **Keeps Andy informed without requiring on-site presence**

**4. Monthly Deep Dives**
- Half-day on-site monthly review (4 hours)
- Review financials, operational metrics, customer feedback
- Strategic planning for next month
- **Maintains strategic alignment despite part-time involvement**

### 6.3 Hiring Strategy for Facility Manager

**Sourcing Channels:**

1. **Poach from competitors**: Identify unhappy managers at Cintas, UniFirst, local competitors
2. **Industry associations**: Textile Rental Services Association (TRSA) job board
3. **LinkedIn**: Search "laundry manager" + "operations manager" in target geography
4. **Indeed/ZipRecruiter**: Post job listing targeting experienced candidates
5. **Trade shows**: American Laundry News Clean Show (equipment expo)

**Interview Focus Areas:**

1. **Technical competence**: "Walk me through wash cycle troubleshooting when clothes aren't coming clean"
2. **Problem-solving**: "A major customer calls at 4pm saying they're missing 10 uniforms needed for tomorrow. What do you do?"
3. **Leadership**: "Tell me about a time you had to manage a difficult employee"
4. **Customer orientation**: "How do you balance production efficiency with customer service?"
5. **Improvement mindset**: "What operational improvements did you implement at your last job?"

**Red Flags:**
- Can't articulate equipment maintenance basics
- Blame-oriented ("It was always someone else's fault")
- Rigid thinking ("We always did it this way")
- Poor communication skills (critical for customer interaction)

**Retention Strategy:**

**Compensation:**
- Market rate + 10-15% premium (be the best-paying laundry in town)
- Annual bonus tied to EBITDA (5-10% of salary)
- Clear path to equity or profit-sharing (Year 2-3)

**Culture:**
- Autonomy: "This is YOUR facility to run"
- Respect: "I value your expertise, I'm here to support not micromanage"
- Growth: "Let's build this together, there's upside for you"

**Work-Life Balance:**
- Strict 40-hour weeks (no chronic overtime)
- Backup coverage for vacations (Andy fills in or part-timer)
- Flexible scheduling where possible

**Goal: 5+ year retention (vs. industry average 2-3 years)**

### 6.4 Risk Mitigation for Part-Time Owner

**Risk 1: Facility Manager Quits**
- **Probability**: Medium (25% in first 2 years)
- **Impact**: HIGH (business continuity at risk)
- **Mitigations**:
  - Cross-train 2nd in command (processing lead) to step up temporarily
  - Andy has 2 weeks to hire replacement (can fill in personally short-term)
  - Document all SOPs so Andy can run operations temporarily
  - Maintain relationship with previous manager (rehire possibility)
  - Offer retention bonus at 1-year mark

**Risk 2: Major Equipment Failure**
- **Probability**: Medium (1-2 per year)
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (temporary capacity loss)
- **Mitigations**:
  - Predictive maintenance program (Section 5.3)
  - Equipment replacement fund (reserve $10k/year)
  - Backup vendor relationships (rent temporary equipment)
  - Service agreements with equipment suppliers (4-hour response time)

**Risk 3: Regulatory Violation**
- **Probability**: Low (5% per year if proactive)
- **Impact**: HIGH (fines, permit revocation risk)
- **Mitigations**:
  - Monthly compliance checklist (wastewater testing, safety audits)
  - Annual compliance consultant review ($1,500-2,500)
  - Manager trained on regulatory requirements
  - Andy reviews compliance reports monthly

**Risk 4: Major Customer Loss**
- **Probability**: Medium (10% per year for large customers)
- **Impact**: Medium to High (depends on concentration)
- **Mitigations**:
  - Diversify customer base (no customer >10% revenue)
  - Quarterly customer satisfaction surveys
  - Andy personally maintains relationships with top 10 customers
  - Proactive customer service (respond to issues same-day)

**Risk 5: Andy Time Commitment Creep**
- **Probability**: HIGH (70% of part-time owners get sucked in)
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (defeats part-time goal)
- **Mitigations**:
  - Strict time boundaries (calendar block, say no to non-critical)
  - Systems prevent need for Andy involvement (automation)
  - Empower facility manager to make decisions without approval
  - Track actual time spent monthly, adjust if exceeding target

**Overall Feasibility Assessment:**

**Year 1:** FEASIBLE but challenging (15-20 hrs/week required)
**Year 2+:** HIGHLY FEASIBLE (5-10 hrs/week realistic)

**Critical success factors:**
1. Hire excellent facility manager (non-negotiable)
2. Build systems proactively (don't skip this)
3. Set clear boundaries and stick to them
4. Be willing to jump in during emergencies (rare but necessary)

**Andy's systems/tech background is IDEAL for this model:**
- Build software tools to enable remote management
- Data-driven decision making vs. gut feel
- Process optimization mindset
- Comfortable delegating vs. hands-on doing

## 7. YOUNG-PEOPLE DETERRENCE & COMPETITIVE MOAT

### 7.1 Why Young Entrepreneurs Avoid This Business

**Physical Deterrents:**

**1. Hot & Uncomfortable**
- Commercial laundry facilities: 85-95°F ambient temperature
- Near dryers/boilers: 100-110°F
- Humid environment (60-80% humidity)
- Physical sensation: Standing in a sauna for 8 hours
- **Young person reaction**: "I'll work in air-conditioned tech startup instead"

**2. Heavy Labor**
- Wet laundry is HEAVY (50-75 lb washers, wet weight adds 50%)
- Loading/unloading washers: Lift 30-40 lbs repeatedly (100+ times/day)
- Moving carts: Push/pull 200-400 lb carts
- Standing all day: 8-10 hours on concrete floors
- **Young person reaction**: "I'll get a desk job that doesn't wreck my back"

**3. Dirty & Unglamorous**
- Handle soiled uniforms (grease, oil, bodily fluids)
- Shop towels covered in automotive fluids/chemicals
- Healthcare linens with blood/biological matter
- Smell: Industrial detergents + soiled laundry = unpleasant
- **Young person reaction**: "I want work I can post on Instagram"

**4. Uncool & Unsexy**
- Can't brag at parties: "I own a laundry business"
- No tech mystique, no mission-driven narrative
- Unglamorous clientele (mechanics, factory workers vs. tech founders)
- Physical location: Industrial park (not trendy downtown)
- **Young person reaction**: "My friends will think I'm a failure"

**Capital Intensity Deterrents:**

**5. High Upfront Investment**
- $300-600k to start from scratch (equipment, facility)
- Not bootstrappable like SaaS, consulting, e-commerce
- VC/investor funding unavailable (not high-growth, not tech)
- **Young person reality**: "I don't have $50k for down payment"

**6. Equipment Complexity**
- Requires mechanical aptitude (boilers, industrial equipment)
- Not "figure it out on YouTube" friendly
- Risk of costly mistakes (break $30k washer)
- **Young person skill mismatch**: Digital natives, not mechanical

**7. Regulatory Burden**
- Wastewater permits, OSHA compliance, insurance
- Boring paperwork and bureaucracy
- Ongoing reporting requirements
- **Young person reaction**: "Too much red tape, I want to move fast"

**Business Model Deterrents:**

**8. Slow Growth**
- No "viral growth," no "exponential scaling"
- Growth = adding one route at a time (linear)
- Customer acquisition: B2B sales (slow, relationship-based)
- **Young person expectation mismatch**: Wants "hockey stick growth"

**9. Low Exit Multiples (Perception)**
- Not venture-backable (no 100x returns)
- PE multiples: 3-5x EBITDA (vs. 10-20x for SaaS)
- **Young person**: "Why build this when I could build next Uber?"
- **Reality**: 3-5x on $200k EBITDA in 5 years = $600k-1M vs. 99% of startups fail

**10. Lifestyle Constraints**
- Can't work remotely from Bali
- Physical presence required (especially Year 1)
- Early morning hours (drivers start 7am, processing by 6am)
- Weekend work possible (catch-up during busy periods)
- **Young person**: "Where's my 4-hour workweek?"

### 7.2 Owner Demographics & Opportunity

**Typical Current Owners:**
- Age: 55-75 years old
- Background: Blue-collar, worked way up from driver/operator
- Education: High school or trade school (not college)
- Tenure: Owned business 20-30 years
- Technology: Still using pen/paper, Excel at best
- **Retirement wave**: 10,000 Baby Boomers/day hitting 65 = massive succession opportunity

**Why This Creates Opportunity for Andy:**

**1. Technology Arbitrage**
- Existing owners don't use route optimization software → Andy improves margins 15-25%
- Manual inventory tracking → Andy implements RFID → saves 15 hrs/week
- Paper-based operations → Andy builds dashboards → enables remote management
- **Competitive advantage through basic tech adoption**

**2. Systems vs. Hard Work**
- Old owners: "I work 60 hours/week, that's how you succeed"
- Andy: "I work 10 hours/week, my systems do the work"
- Old owners: Can't attract buyers because business requires their presence
- Andy: Builds systems that make business owner-independent → higher exit value

**3. Succession Opportunity**
- Many owners have no succession plan (kids don't want "dirty" business)
- Willing to seller-finance because they want business to continue (legacy)
- Often price based on asset value (equipment) not earnings potential
- **Andy can buy below market because of motivated seller**

**4. Immediate Margin Improvement**
- Existing owner: 15-20% EBITDA margins (industry average)
- Andy Year 1: 25-30% margins through systems (Section 5)
- Andy Year 2: 30-35% margins with full optimization
- **Purchase at 3x old margins, exit at 4x new margins = 300% return**

### 7.3 Competitive Sustainability

**Why Young People Will CONTINUE to Avoid This:**

**Generational trends working in Andy's favor:**

1. **Continued shift to knowledge work**: College enrollment stable, preference for desk jobs increasing
2. **Physical labor stigma**: Trades shortage (everyone wants to code)
3. **Instant gratification culture**: TikTok generation won't tolerate 5-year build
4. **Risk aversion**: Student debt makes high-capital businesses scary
5. **Status seeking**: Entrepreneurship = tech startup (not laundry) in young people's minds

**Economic moats remain strong:**
- Capital requirements aren't decreasing (equipment still costs $300k+)
- Regulatory complexity increasing (more environmental rules)
- Customer switching costs stable (branded uniforms still lock in customers)
- Route density advantages compound over time

**Competitive threats to monitor:**

1. **PE consolidation**: Roll-ups may increase competitive pressure (but also exit opportunity)
2. **National player expansion**: Cintas/UniFirst may target small accounts (but service quality gap protects)
3. **Tech disruption**: None visible (laundry still requires physical processing)
4. **Offshore competition**: Impossible (laundry is local, daily pickup required)

**Verdict: 10-15 year moat is defensible**

Young-people deterrence + high switching costs + capital intensity = sustainable competitive advantage for existing operators who embrace systems/technology.

### 8.3 Deal Structure Recommendations

**Recommended Structure for Andy:**

**Scenario A: Seller-Financed Component (BEST)**

Purchase price: $250k
- SBA 7(a) loan: $175k (70% LTV @ 8.5%, 10-year)
- Andy cash: $50k (20%)
- Seller note: $25k (10%, 5-year balloon @ 6%)
- **Total cash required from Andy: $50k + $15k working capital = $65k** ✓

**Seller Note Terms:**
- Interest-only for 3 years: $1,500/year
- Balloon payment Year 5: $25k (from cash flow or refinance)
- Subordinated to SBA loan
- Personal guarantee from seller (they want business to succeed)

**Why seller accepts:**
- Gets $175k cash at close (SBA portion)
- Earns 6% on $25k note (better than bank CD)
- Keeps stake in business success (if Andy fails, they get business back)
- Tax advantage: Spread capital gains over 5 years vs. lump sum

**Scenario B: Equipment Allocation (for SBA 504):**

Purchase price: $250k allocated as:
- Equipment/FF&E: $180k (72%)
- Customer list/goodwill: $50k (20%)
- Inventory: $20k (8%)

Structure:
- SBA 504 loan: $144k (80% of equipment @ 6.5%, 25-year)
- SBA 7(a) loan: $56k (goodwill + working capital @ 8.5%, 10-year)
- Andy cash: $50k (20% down)
- **Total cash required: $50k + $15k working capital = $65k** ✓

**Why this works:**
- Lower blended rate (6.5%/8.5% vs. all 8.5%)
- 25-year amortization on equipment = lower payment ($900/month vs. $1,800)
- Requires equipment appraisal ($1,500 cost)
- Takes 60-90 days to close (vs. 30-45 for 7(a) only)

**Scenario C: All Cash (if Andy has capital):**

Purchase price: $250k
- Andy cash: $250k + $20k working capital = $270k total

**Pros:**
- No debt service ($29k/year savings)
- Year 1 cash flow: $100k EBITDA - $50k salary = $50k (vs. $20.6k with debt)
- Faster decision-making (no lender approval)

**Cons:**
- Requires $270k liquid capital (Andy likely doesn't have this)
- Lower ROI due to less leverage (still good, but not 2,779%)
- Opportunity cost (could use capital for multiple deals)

**RECOMMENDATION: Scenario A (Seller-Financed Component)**
- Minimizes cash required ($65k vs. $270k)
- Seller motivation (they want deal to close)
- Flexible structure (can refinance seller note in Year 3-4)
- SBA provides credibility and structure

### 8.4 Debt Service Coverage & Cash Flow Safety

**Key Metric: Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)**

DSCR = EBITDA ÷ Annual Debt Service
- Bank requirement: 1.25x minimum
- Safe zone: 1.5x+
- Risky: <1.15x

**Scenario A Debt Service:**
- SBA 7(a): $175k @ 8.5%, 10-year = $2,166/month = $26k/year
- Seller note: $25k @ 6%, interest-only = $1,500/year
- **Total debt service: $27,500/year**

**DSCR by Year:**
- Year 0: $100k ÷ $27.5k = 3.6x ✓ EXCELLENT
- Year 1: $154k ÷ $27.5k = 5.6x ✓ EXCELLENT
- Year 2: $204k ÷ $27.5k = 7.4x ✓ EXCELLENT

**Safety Margin Analysis:**

**Downside scenario: Revenue declines 20% in Year 1**
- Revenue: $320k (vs. $440k base case)
- EBITDA: $80k (25% margin - no improvement)
- Debt service: $27,500
- Owner comp: $40k (Andy takes pay cut)
- Cash flow: $80k - $27.5k - $40k = $12.5k
- DSCR: 2.9x ✓ Still safe

**Break-even scenario:**
- EBITDA required: $27,500 + $40k (min owner comp) = $67,500
- At 25% margin: $270k revenue
- **Conclusion: Business can decline 32% and still cover debt + minimal owner pay**

### 8.5 Working Capital Requirements

**Initial Working Capital Needs:**

**Day 1:**
- Inventory (clean uniforms for new deliveries): $5-8k
- Chemicals (detergents, 90-day supply): $2-3k
- Fuel (for trucks): $1k
- Cash reserve (payroll buffer): $8-12k
- **Total: $16-24k**

**Ongoing Working Capital:**
- Accounts receivable: 30-45 days (customers pay after service)
- Weekly billing cycle: ~$8-10k outstanding at any time
- **Need: $15-20k ongoing**

**Working Capital Sources:**
- Include in SBA loan (part of acquisition financing)
- OR seller provides as part of transition (customer deposits, inventory)
- Most sellers willing to leave $10-15k working capital in business

**Cash Flow Cycle:**
- Mon-Fri: Provide service (incur costs)
- Mon-Fri: Deliver and invoice customers (same day)
- 15-45 days later: Receive payment
- **Float period: 15-45 days**

**Mitigation: Accelerate Collections**
- Offer 2% discount for same-day ACH payment (reduces float to 0-3 days)
- Auto-charge credit cards on file (70%+ of customers)
- Net 15 terms (vs. net 30) for new customers
- **Target: <20 day average collection period**

## 9. RISKS, CHALLENGES & MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### 9.1 Customer Concentration Risk

**Risk**: Large customer represents >15% of revenue, loss creates cash flow crisis

**Typical Scenario**:
- Manufacturing plant: $60k/year (15% of $400k revenue)
- Plant closes or switches vendors
- Overnight loss of $60k revenue = $42k EBITDA loss (70% margin on loss)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Diversification Target**: No customer >10% revenue
   - 40+ customers: Top customer = $40k max (10% of $400k)
   - If acquiring business with concentration, prioritize new customer acquisition immediately

2. **Contract Lock-In**: Multi-year agreements with early termination fees
   - 3-year contracts: If customer leaves Year 1, pays 50% of remaining contract value
   - Reduces risk of sudden departure

3. **Service Excellence**: Make switching painful through exceptional service
   - Same-day response to issues
   - Personal owner relationship with top 10 customers (Andy calls monthly)
   - Customer satisfaction surveys quarterly

4. **Early Warning Systems**: Monitor at-risk customers
   - Late payments = early warning signal
   - Complaints = customer dissatisfaction
   - Volume decline = business struggles
   - Proactively address issues before customer churns

**Monitoring**: Monthly customer concentration report
- Flag any customer >8% (early warning)
- Action plan if customer >12% (aggressive new sales to diversify)

### 9.2 Equipment Breakdown Risk

**Risk**: Major equipment failure causes multi-day outage, lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction

**Typical Scenario**:
- Washer transmission failure: $3-5k repair, 3-5 days downtime
- Can't process 1,000 lbs/day × 4 days = 4,000 lbs backlog
- Customer deliveries missed = complaints, potential churn
- Overtime to catch up = $1,000-2,000 additional labor

**Total cost: $5-8k per incident**

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Predictive Maintenance Program** (Section 5.3)
   - Monthly inspections reduce breakdowns 70%
   - Cost: $200/month = $2,400/year << $5-8k per breakdown

2. **Equipment Redundancy**:
   - Run at 70-80% capacity (not 100%)
   - If one washer down, other 2 can absorb load
   - Slightly longer hours (9-10 hour days) vs. turning customers away

3. **Backup Vendor Relationships**:
   - Identify laundromat with excess capacity (rent time)
   - Equipment rental companies (temporary washer/dryer)
   - Cost: $500-1,500/day but avoids losing customers

4. **Service Contracts**:
   - Annual maintenance contracts with equipment vendors
   - Priority service: 4-hour response time
   - Loaner equipment while repairs in progress
   - Cost: $1,200-2,400/year for 4-6 machines

5. **Equipment Replacement Fund**:
   - Reserve $10k/year for capital replacements
   - Major overhaul every 5-7 years ($40-50k)
   - Avoids scrambling for emergency capital

**Insurance**: Business interruption insurance
- Covers lost revenue during extended outages (>3 days)
- Cost: $800-1,500/year
- Peace of mind for catastrophic scenarios

### 9.3 Labor Challenges (Hiring & Retention)

**Risk**: Can't find/retain qualified employees, especially facility manager

**Industry Challenge**: 24% of laundry operators cite hiring as ongoing issue

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Facility Manager Retention** (Critical):
   - Pay 10-15% above market ($50-65k vs. $45-55k)
   - Annual bonus: 5-10% of salary tied to EBITDA
   - Equity path: Offer 5-10% equity vesting over 5 years (Year 2+)
   - Autonomy: "Your facility, your decisions, I support you"
   - **Goal**: 5+ year retention

2. **Processing Staff**:
   - Competitive wages: $15-18/hr (vs. min wage $13-15)
   - Flexible scheduling: Accommodate school, family needs
   - Bilingual bonus: +$1/hr if Spanish speaker (many Latino workers)
   - Training program: Clear path from entry-level to lead ($15 → $20/hr)

3. **Driver Retention**:
   - CDL premium: $22-25/hr for CDL holders
   - Performance bonus: $50-100/month for perfect safety record
   - Route consistency: Same route daily (vs. rotating)
   - Technology: GPS/route software reduces frustration

4. **Culture & Environment**:
   - AC in facility: Install mini-splits ($3-5k) to reduce heat
   - Break area: Comfortable space, free coffee/snacks
   - Recognition: Employee of month, $100 gift card
   - Respect: Treat workers with dignity, involve in decisions

5. **Hiring Pipeline**:
   - Partner with temp agencies: 90-day temp-to-hire
   - Referral bonuses: $250-500 for employee referrals who stay 6+ months
   - Indeed/ZipRecruiter: Sponsored job posts
   - Community organizations: Hispanic chambers, church groups

**Backup Plan**: Andy can personally operate facility 1-2 weeks during transition if manager quits (painful but doable)

### 9.4 Regulatory & Environmental Risk

**Risk**: Wastewater violation, OSHA fine, permit revocation

**Potential Scenarios**:
- Wastewater pH out of range: $5-25k fine
- Failed wastewater test: Permit suspension threat
- OSHA chemical handling violation: $7-15k fine
- Healthcare infection control issue: Customer contract loss

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Monthly Compliance Checklist**:
   - Wastewater: Test pH, BOD, TSS weekly (in-house or lab)
   - Chemical: SDS sheets current, PPE available, training logged
   - Equipment: Safety guards in place, emergency stops functional
   - Documentation: Logs maintained, reports submitted on time

2. **Annual Compliance Audit**:
   - Hire environmental consultant: $1,500-2,500
   - Pre-audit before official inspection
   - Fix issues proactively
   - Demonstrates good faith compliance

3. **Regulatory Relationships**:
   - Establish rapport with local sanitation district inspector
   - Transparency: Disclose issues immediately, show corrective action
   - Participate in industry association (TRSA): Stay informed on rule changes

4. **Water Recycling Investment** (Year 2-3):
   - Reduces discharge 80-90% = less regulatory scrutiny
   - Environmental benefit = goodwill with regulators
   - Cost savings justify investment (Section 3.2)

5. **Insurance**:
   - Environmental liability insurance: $1,000-2,000/year
   - Covers cleanup costs, fines, legal defense
   - Required by most facility leases anyway

**Probability**: LOW if proactive (5% per year)
**Impact**: MEDIUM ($10-30k cost if occurs)
**Mitigation Cost**: $3-5k/year (well worth it)

### 9.5 Competitive Threats

**Risk 1: National Player Expansion**

**Scenario**: Cintas/UniFirst targets small accounts in Andy's territory

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (increasing as they seek growth)

**Impact**: Pricing pressure, customer poaching attempts

**Mitigation**:
- Service quality moat: Respond same-day, personal touch
- Relationship depth: Andy personally knows decision-makers
- Price positioning: 10-15% below nationals, but emphasize value not price
- Contract lock-in: 3-year agreements with switching costs
- Niche focus: Segments nationals don't serve well (small shops, specialized needs)

**Risk 2: PE Rollup Competitor**

**Scenario**: PE-backed competitor consolidates market, increases competition

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (PE active in laundry M&A)

**Impact**: Could compress margins, or create exit opportunity

**Mitigation**:
- This is actually opportunity: Andy could be acquisition target
- Build business as potential add-on (clean financials, systems, growth)
- Exit to rollup in Year 5-7 at premium multiple

**Risk 3: Local Competitor Price War**

**Scenario**: Competitor drops prices 20-30% to steal customers

**Likelihood**: LOW (irrational, hurts both parties)

**Impact**: Margin pressure if Andy matches, or customer loss if doesn't

**Mitigation**:
- Don't compete on price alone (compete on service)
- Educate customers on value (reliability, quality, responsiveness)
- Lock customers in contracts (can't switch mid-term)
- Focus on customer segments that value service >price (healthcare, manufacturing)

**Risk 4: Customer In-Sourcing**

**Scenario**: Large customer brings laundry in-house

**Likelihood**: VERY LOW (capital intensive, not core competency)

**Impact**: Loss of single customer (concentration risk)

**Mitigation**:
- Happens rarely (mostly hospital systems with 1,000+ beds)
- Diversification prevents single customer loss from being fatal
- Partner with customer: Offer to manage their on-site laundry (fee for service)

**Overall Competitive Risk**: LOW to MEDIUM
- Local/regional business with geographic moat
- High switching costs protect existing customer base
- Service quality differentiates from nationals
- Systems/tech enable cost advantage vs. old-school locals

### 9.6 Economic Downturn Risk

**Risk**: Recession causes customer business failures, volume declines

**Typical Impact**:
- 2008 recession: Industrial laundry revenue declined 10-15%
- Customer failures: 2-5% churn (vs. 5-10% normal)
- Volume declines: Customers reduce employee counts

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Recession-Resistant Customer Mix**:
   - Healthcare: Recession-proof (people still get sick)
   - Target: 40-50% healthcare customers
   - Avoid: Hospitality, restaurants (cyclical, high failure rate)

2. **Geographic Diversification**:
   - Serve 3-5 zip codes (not single industrial park)
   - If one area struggles, others may remain stable
   - Don't over-concentrate in single industry

3. **Low Debt Service**:
   - After Year 5: Debt paid down 50%
   - Cash flow cushion: DSCR >3x provides safety margin
   - Can survive 30%+ revenue decline and still cover debt

4. **Variable Cost Structure**:
   - 60% variable costs (labor, utilities, chemicals)
   - Can reduce hours, lay off staff if volume drops
   - Fixed costs (rent, insurance): Only 25-30% of revenue

5. **Pricing Strategy**:
   - Avoid racing to bottom during recession
   - Maintain pricing, accept some volume loss
   - Cheaper to keep existing customers than replace them
   - Offer payment plans vs. cutting prices

**Historical Performance**:
- Industrial laundry declined less than overall economy (essential service)
- Recovery faster (businesses rehire = need uniforms)
- Well-run operators survived 2008-09 with minimal impact

## 10. EXIT STRATEGY & VALUATION

### 10.1 Buyer Types & Exit Paths

**Strategic Buyers (Most Common):**

**1. Regional Laundry Consolidators**
- **Profile**: $5-20M revenue operators in adjacent markets
- **Motivation**: Geographic expansion, add customers in new territory
- **Valuation**: 3.5-4.5x EBITDA (premium for growth, systems)
- **Probability**: HIGH (many active in each region)
- **Example**: Regional player in City A acquires Andy's business in City B to enter new market

**2. National Players (Add-On Acquisitions)**
- **Profile**: Cintas, UniFirst, Alsco seeking bolt-on acquisitions
- **Motivation**: Local market share, eliminate competitor
- **Valuation**: 4-5x EBITDA (strategic premium)
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (selective, focus on $2M+ revenue typically)
- **Note**: Andy's $900k Year 5 revenue may be small, but could appeal if fills geographic gap

**3. Private Equity Rollups**
- **Profile**: PE firms consolidating fragmented industries
- **Motivation**: Add-on to portfolio company (already own laundries)
- **Valuation**: 4-6x EBITDA (highest multiples, growth-focused)
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (PE active, but selective)
- **Example**: Wind Point Partners, Morgan Stanley Capital Partners have rolled up laundries

**Financial Buyers (Less Common):**

**4. Individual Buyers (Like Andy)**
- **Profile**: Aspiring entrepreneurs, SBA buyers
- **Motivation**: Lifestyle business, semi-passive income
- **Valuation**: 2.5-3.5x EBITDA (lowest multiples)
- **Probability**: HIGH (always buyers for profitable SMBs)
- **Note**: Andy's systems make business attractive to individual buyer

**5. Management Buyout**
- **Profile**: Facility manager buys business
- **Motivation**: Been running it, wants ownership
- **Valuation**: 2.5-3x EBITDA, heavy seller financing
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (if manager is strong, has savings)
- **Structure**: Andy seller-finances 60-80% over 5-7 years

**Worst Case (Backup):**

**6. Asset Sale / Wind Down**
- **Scenario**: Can't find buyer for business as going concern
- **Liquidation**: Sell equipment, customer list separately
- **Value**: $100-150k equipment + $50-100k customer list = $150-250k
- **Note**: Unlikely if business is profitable (always buyers for cash flow)

### 10.2 Value Drivers & Exit Multiple Optimization

**What Buyers Pay Premium For:**

**1. Systems & Processes (Andy's Edge)**
- **Impact**: +0.5-1.0x multiple
- **Evidence**: Documented SOPs, tech stack, automated workflows
- **Buyer appeal**: Reduces risk, easier transition, less owner-dependent
- **Andy advantage**: RFID, route optimization, dashboards = differentiated

**2. Owner Independence**
- **Impact**: +0.5-1.0x multiple
- **Evidence**: Business runs with facility manager, Andy 5-10 hrs/week
- **Buyer appeal**: Don't need to work 40+ hours, can be passive/part-time
- **Key**: Facility manager stays with new owner (retention agreement)

**3. Growth Trajectory**
- **Impact**: +0.5-1.5x multiple
- **Evidence**: 15-20% annual revenue growth (Andy's 5-year track record)
- **Buyer appeal**: Acquiring growth, not just static cash flow
- **Narrative**: "Route density model has room to 2x revenue without new routes"

**4. Customer Quality & Diversification**
- **Impact**: +0.3-0.5x multiple
- **Evidence**: 50+ customers, no customer >10%, 90%+ retention, 60% healthcare
- **Buyer appeal**: Low churn risk, stable revenue, recession-resistant
- **Contrast**: Competitors may have concentration risk (single hospital = 40% revenue)

**5. Facility & Equipment Condition**
- **Impact**: +0.2-0.5x multiple
- **Evidence**: Well-maintained equipment, <5 years old, no deferred maintenance
- **Buyer appeal**: No immediate capex required
- **Andy advantage**: Predictive maintenance program = excellent equipment condition

**6. Margin Profile**
- **Impact**: +0.5-1.0x multiple
- **Evidence**: 38-40% EBITDA margins (vs. 25-30% industry average)
- **Buyer appeal**: Best-in-class operations, margin upside already captured
- **Note**: Buyer pays for margins, not potential (potential = lower multiple)

**7. Intellectual Property / Proprietary Systems**
- **Impact**: +0.3-0.8x multiple
- **Evidence**: Custom RFID software, route optimization algorithms, customer portal
- **Buyer appeal**: Competitive moat, hard to replicate
- **Andy advantage**: Tech background = proprietary systems worth $$

**Base Multiple**: 3.0x EBITDA (generic small industrial laundry)
**Andy's Multiple**: 4.0-5.0x EBITDA (best-in-class systems, growth, margins)
**Premium**: +33-67% due to value drivers above

- Weekly cadence = high touch, hard to disrupt
- Mild economic sensitivity (10-15% decline in recession)
- **Verdict**: Highly essential, recession-resistant

**3. Switching Costs (SCORE: 9/10)**
- Branded uniforms = $1,000-3,000 sunk cost per customer
- Service disruption = operational chaos
- 3-year contracts with termination fees
- Relationship/trust built over years
- **Verdict**: Very high switching costs, sticky customers

**4. Fragmented Market (SCORE: 8/10)**
- Top 4 players: 28% market share (72% fragmented)
- Thousands of local/regional operators
- Easy to be #1 in local geography
- **Verdict**: Highly fragmented, acquisition opportunities abundant

**5. Consolidation Opportunity (SCORE: 7/10)**
- PE actively rolling up industry
- Aging owners (retirement wave)
- Andy can buy #2 and #3 in market and consolidate
- Exit to regional consolidator or PE rollup
- **Verdict**: Clear consolidation thesis, exit path visible

**6. Owner-Dependent / Improvable (SCORE: 10/10)**
- Typical owner: Works 60 hrs/week, no systems, manual processes

- Transform from owner-dependent to manager-run
- **Verdict**: Perfect fit for Andy's systems expertise

**7. Simple to Understand (SCORE: 6/10)**
- **Pros**: Business model is straightforward (pickup, wash, deliver)
- **Cons**: Operational complexity (facility + routes + equipment + compliance)
- **Verdict**: More complex than pure route business, but Andy's manufacturing background helps

**OVERALL HOLT VENTURES FIT: 59/70 (84%) - STRONG FIT**

**Recommendation**: PURSUE aggressively, with focus on existing business acquisition (not startup)

### 11.2 Andy's Competitive Advantages

**Why Andy Specifically Should Do This:**

**1. Systems Thinking (Perfect Match)**
- Andy's superpower: Building systems that scale
- Industrial laundry: Has 4 systems leverage points (Section 5: route, throughput, maintenance, cost control)
- **Fit**: 15-30% margin improvement = $50-100k additional EBITDA on typical acquisition

**2. Developer Background (Unique Edge)**
- Custom RFID tracking system: $20k commercial solution → $6k DIY (Section 5.5)
- Route optimization software integration
- Customer portal builds competitive moat
- **Fit**: Tech-enabled laundry = differentiator, commands premium exit multiple

**3. Route Optimization Expertise**
- Experience with logistics, density economics
- Similar to waste/medical waste models Andy studied
- **Fit**: 15-25% efficiency gains achievable (Section 4.3)

**4. Manufacturing Background (Throughput Mindset)**
- Understands bottleneck analysis, PPOH metrics
- Process optimization is core competency
- **Fit**: Throughput maximization = 8-12% margin improvement (Section 5.2)

**5. Part-Time Constraint (Forces Systems Building)**
- MUST build systems to run remotely
- Can't rely on being on-site 40 hrs/week
- **Fit**: Constraint drives better business design (manager-run, documented, automated)

**6. Risk Tolerance (Calculated)**
- Equipment/facility intensity would scare most
- Andy sees: Existing business acquisition mitigates risk
- Comfortable with $50-70k cash investment
- **Fit**: Willing to tackle "harder" business for better returns

### 11.3 Red Flags & Deal Breakers

**WALK AWAY IF:**

**1. Customer Concentration >25%**
- Single customer >15% of revenue = too risky
- Top 5 customers >40% = vulnerable
- **Mitigation**: Can accept if 3+ year contracts AND customer is hospital/stable

**2. Deferred Maintenance Crisis**
- Equipment obviously neglected (rust, broken, noisy)
- Facility in disrepair (leaks, electrical issues)
- **Cost**: Could require $50-100k immediate capex
- **Verdict**: Walk away unless purchase price reduced by 2x deferred maintenance cost

**3. Lease Issues**
- <2 years remaining = renewal risk
- Landlord won't allow assignment = can't transfer lease
- Rent >15% of revenue = occupancy cost too high
- **Verdict**: Walk away unless lease extension/assignment negotiated pre-close

**4. Regulatory Violations**
- Active wastewater permit violations
- OSHA citations unresolved
- Lawsuits pending (employee, customer, environmental)
- **Verdict**: Walk away unless violations resolved and verified BEFORE close

**5. Declining Revenue Trend**
- 15%+ decline year-over-year (not COVID-related)
- Customer churn >15% annually
- Indicates fundamental business problems (service quality, competition)
- **Verdict**: Walk away OR deep discount (1.5-2x EBITDA vs. 2.5-3x)

**6. Owner is Critical to Operations**
- Owner runs routes personally (no driver will stay)
- Owner is only one who can operate equipment
- Customers have personal relationship with owner (won't transfer)
- **Verdict**: Walk away (can't transition to manager-run model)

**7. Seller Won't Provide Financials**
- No tax returns, no P&L
- "Books are messy" or "mostly cash"
- Indicates: Potentially hiding losses, tax evasion, or business isn't profitable
- **Verdict**: Walk away immediately

**YELLOW FLAGS (Caution, But Negotiable):**

- Facility needs minor upgrades ($10-20k): Reduce price or seller fixes
- 1-2 key employees leaving: Build retention plan, offer bonuses
- Equipment 10+ years old: Budget for replacement, reduce price
- Single industry concentration (all automotive): Diversification plan
- Owner staying 30-60 days only: Extend to 90 days transition minimum

### 11.4 Final Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: PURSUE INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY / UNIFORM SERVICES**

**Investment Thesis Validation:**
✓ "Dirty, essential" business with young-people deterrence
✓ Double moat: Equipment/facility + regulatory compliance
✓ Route density economics with systems leverage
✓ 15-30% margin improvement opportunity for Andy
✓ Manager-run feasible with proper systems (5-10 hrs/week Year 2+)
✓ $75-200k budget viable through SBA acquisition financing
✓ Clear exit path to strategic/PE buyers at 4-5x EBITDA

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Acquire existing business** (not startup) - Equipment/customers in place
2. **Hire excellent facility manager** - Non-negotiable for part-time model
3. **Implement systems immediately** - Route optimization, dashboards, SOPs (Year 1)
4. **Avoid customer concentration** - No customer >10% revenue
5. **Focus on healthcare/manufacturing** - Recession-resistant, low churn

**Expected Returns:**
- Year 1-5 cumulative cash flow: $625k
- Year 5 exit proceeds: $1,320k
- Total return on $70k invested: $1,945k (27.8x MOIC)
- IRR: ~95%
- Owner time Year 2+: 5-10 hrs/week

**Next Steps:**
1. **Identify target businesses** (BizBuySell, business brokers, direct outreach)
   - Search terms: "laundry", "uniform service", "linen service", "industrial laundry"
   - Target: $250-500k revenue, $60-125k EBITDA, aging owner
2. **SBA lender pre-qualification** (establish $200k borrowing capacity)
3. **Network with industry** (TRSA events, equipment vendors, local laundry owners)
4. **Build financial model** (template for analyzing deals)
5. **Facility manager search** (identify potential hires proactively)

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-6: Deal sourcing and evaluation (review 10-20 businesses)
- Months 7-9: LOI, due diligence, financing (on target acquisition)
- Month 10: Close and transition
- Months 11-18: Stabilization and systems implementation
- Years 2-5: Optimization and growth
- Years 5-7: Exit preparation and sale

**Risk-Adjusted Verdict: STRONG GO** ✓

This opportunity scores 84% on Holt Ventures criteria, aligns perfectly with Andy's systems expertise, offers excellent returns, and fits part-time constraint with proper structure. The operational complexity is higher than simple service routes, but creates defensible moat and prevents competition. Recommended.
