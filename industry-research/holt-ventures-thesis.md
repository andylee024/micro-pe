# Business Plan: Operational Leverage Businesses
**Date:** February 2026
**Focus:** Dirty, essential businesses with equipment + licensing moats
**Strategy:** Acquire 1-2/year, build operational systems, scale through efficiency

---

## Investment Thesis

**We acquire dirty, operationally complex businesses that young people avoid but society needs.**

### Why These Businesses

**The Moat:**
- **Equipment barrier** - $50k-500k in specialized equipment, vehicles, or real estate deters casual entrants
- **Licensing barrier** - State permits, EPA regulations, certifications create second layer of defense
- **Double moat = time to learn** - We can acquire and learn operations without new competitors appearing overnight

**The Opportunity:**
- **Retiring baby boomers** - Owners age 60-75, kids don't want "dirty" businesses
- **Young people avoid** - Unsexy, blue-collar, complex operations, regulatory burden
- **Essential services** - Society needs garbage collection, car washes, salvage yards, treatment centers
- **Under-valued** - Sellers discount because they seem low-tech, operationally intense

**Our Edge:**
- **Not afraid of dirty/complex** - We'll do what others avoid
- **Systems thinking** - We see operational leverage (route optimization, throughput, inventory management)
- **Speed to competence** - We learn operations fast, build playbooks, hire managers
- **Operational improvements = margin expansion** - Small efficiency gains compound at volume

---

## What We're Looking For

### Business Characteristics

**Volume/Throughput Model:**
- Revenue from many transactions, not few large contracts
- Examples: # of cars washed/day, # of recycling pickups, # of parts sold, # of patient-days
- Margin expansion from operational efficiency, not pricing power

**Equipment + Licensing Moat (Double Barrier):**
- **Equipment:** $50k-500k capital requirement (trucks, machinery, real estate, specialized tools)
- **Licensing:** State permits, EPA/DOT regulations, certifications, insurance requirements
- Takes 6-18 months AND capital to replicate → defensive moat

**Dirty/Unsexy/Complex:**
- Young people avoid: Garbage, fluids, manual labor, regulatory burden, blue-collar
- Retiring owners can't find successors
- PE ignores: Too small, too operational, too "dirty"

**Essential Services:**
- Society needs these businesses (not discretionary)
- B2B or B2B2C (not pure consumer retail/fashion)
- Recession-resilient or counter-cyclical

**Recurring/Sticky Revenue:**
- 50%+ recurring from: Contracts, memberships, customer habit, insurance billing
- Customer switching costs (equipment on-site, contracts, relationship inertia)

**Systematizable Operations:**
- Can build playbooks for: Routes, inventory management, throughput optimization, labor scheduling
- Not craft-dependent (not master electrician)
- Process-driven execution (train managers to run it)

**Clear Operational Improvements:**
- We can identify specific ways to: Reduce costs 10-20%, increase throughput 20-30%, improve margins 5-10 points
- Not vague "better marketing" - actual operational levers

## Search Strategy

### Phase 1: Industry Validation (Weeks 1-3)

**Tier 1 validation (prioritize these 4):**
1. Commercial Recycling
2. Car Washes (express/membership)
3. Auto Salvage Yards
4. Addiction Treatment Centers

**For each, validate:**

**Deal Flow Test:**
- Find 10+ businesses for sale in SoCal (BizBuySell, LoopNet, direct)
- Price range: $150k-500k (3-4x EBITDA)
- If can't find 10 → move to Tier 2

**Equipment Moat Check:**
- What equipment is required? Cost?
- How long to acquire/install?
- Can it be financed or included in purchase?

**Licensing Moat Check:**
- What licenses/permits required?
- Can they transfer with sale? Timeline?
- Ongoing compliance burden?

**Owner Conversations:**
- Talk to 3-5 owners (informational, not buying yet)
- "Why are you selling?" (looking for: retiring, no succession)
- "What's hardest about operations?" (looking for: systematizable problems)
- "Why haven't young people wanted to buy?" (confirming our thesis)

---

### Phase 2: Financial Modeling (Week 4)

**Build underwriting model per business type:**

**Base case assumptions:**
- Revenue: Historical 3-year average
- EBITDA margin: Historical, adjusted for owner salary normalization
- Purchase price: 3-4x adjusted EBITDA
- Manager salary: $60-80k (if owner currently operates)
- Working capital needs

**Operational improvement assumptions (conservative):**
- Route optimization: 10-15% cost reduction (fuel, labor)
- Throughput optimization: 15-20% revenue increase (more volume, same fixed costs)
- Inventory optimization: 10-15% working capital reduction (junk yards)
- Billing optimization: 5-10% margin improvement (addiction centers)

**Stress test:**
- Revenue -20% (lose key customer, recession)
- Equipment failure ($20-50k unplanned CapEx)
- Key employee leaves ($80k to replace + 3 months hiring)

**Return targets:**
- Base case: 20-25% cash-on-cash return by year 3
- Exit: 5-6x multiple (vs. 3-4x acquisition) = 5-8x total return over 5 years

---
