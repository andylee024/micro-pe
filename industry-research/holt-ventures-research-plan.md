# Holt Ventures: Sector Selection Research Plan
**Analyst Perspective:** Micro PE with $200k capital, full-time jobs, 10-15 hours/week capacity
**Objective:** Identify THE ONE sector (not 3-4) to focus all deal sourcing efforts
**Timeline:** 3 weeks to decision (not 3 months)
**Budget:** $500-1,000 max (mostly free research + some paid data)

---

## Part 0: Strategic Constraints (The Reality Check)

### Hard Constraints That Limit Your Options

**Constraint 1: Capital Scarcity ($200k total)**
- **Implication:** You get ONE shot. Can't diversify across sectors.
- **Decision:** Must pick sector with HIGHEST confidence of finding right deal in 6 months
- **Anti-pattern:** Researching all 18 business types equally (analysis paralysis, no action)

**Constraint 2: Time Scarcity (10-15 hrs/week, full-time jobs)**
- **Implication:** Can't be "learning" industries for months. Need fast ramp.
- **Decision:** Prioritize sectors where validation is FAST (days not weeks)
- **Anti-pattern:** Deep industry research before confirming ANY deals exist

**Constraint 3: Single-Sector Focus Requirement**
- **Implication:** Once you start owner conversations, you're "declaring" your focus
- **Decision:** Pick sector where you can credibly claim "I'm serious about this space"
- **Anti-pattern:** Talking to owners in 5 different industries (signals tire-kicker)

**Constraint 4: Remote Management Requirement**
- **Implication:** Business must be manageable with weekend check-ins
- **Decision:** Eliminates high-touch, crisis-driven, or craft-dependent businesses
- **Anti-pattern:** Pursuing businesses that "look good on paper" but need daily presence

---

## Part 1: Research Philosophy (How to Think About This)

### The Micro PE Funnel (What Actually Matters)

Most people research wrong. They try to understand industries deeply before validating deal flow.

**Wrong Sequence:**
1. Deep industry research (market size, trends, competitors) ← Waste of time
2. Build financial models (margins, multiples, returns) ← Hypothetical
3. Talk to owners (oh wait, no one's selling...) ← Too late

**Right Sequence (Micro PE Logic):**
1. **Deal availability** (Are 10+ businesses for sale RIGHT NOW?)
2. **Transition feasibility** (Can we actually operate this post-acquisition?)
3. **Financial viability** (Will this generate acceptable returns?)
4. **Strategic fit** (Does this match our thesis long-term?)

**Why this order?**
- If no deals exist, market size doesn't matter (STOP HERE)
- If we can't transition, great margins don't matter (STOP HERE)
- If returns are bad, macro tailwinds don't matter (STOP HERE)
- Strategic fit only matters if above three pass

### The $200k Investor Mindset

With $200k, you're not a fund. You're an entrepreneur buying one asset.

**Key mindset shifts:**
1. **Speed > Perfection** - You want "good enough to decide" not "institutional quality"
2. **Primary > Secondary** - Talk to sellers directly, don't read reports about industries
3. **Practical > Theoretical** - Focus on "Can I close a deal in 6 months?" not "Is this a good sector?"
4. **Eliminate > Optimize** - Rule out bad options fast, don't optimize between good options

---

## Part 2: The Research Plan (3-Week Sequenced Approach)

### Week 1: Rapid Elimination (Deal Flow + Licensing Killers)
**Time Investment:** 15-20 hours
**Cost:** $0 (all free research)
**Outcome:** Eliminate 12-14 of 18 business types
**Deliverable:** Shortlist of 4-6 "deal flow confirmed" business types

---

#### Day 1-2 (Monday-Tuesday): Deal Flow Validation
**Objective:** Confirm which business types have 10+ actual businesses for sale

**Method: BizBuySell Scavenger Hunt (2 hours per category)**

**Category 1: Paper-Heavy Regulatory Services**

| Permit Expediting | "permit", "expediting", "planning" | ? | Check: Is it permit-only or full GC services? |
| Compliance Auditing | "ISO", "OSHA", "safety", "auditing" | ? | Check: Is it consulting or certification body? |
| Environmental Consulting | "environmental", "industrial hygiene" | ? | Check: Field work vs. desk work ratio? |

| Elevator Service | "elevator", "elevator service" | ? | Check: Independent or OEM-affiliated? |

**Scoring Rules:**
- 🟢 **PASS (10+ listings):** Clear deal flow exists, move to next stage
- 🟡 **MARGINAL (5-9 listings):** Thin market, may need to expand geography or direct sourcing
- 🔴 **FAIL (<5 listings):** Market too thin, ELIMINATE immediately

**Key Questions While Browsing Listings:**
1. What's the asking price range? (Fits $75-200k target?)
2. What's the stated SDE/EBITDA? (Calculate implied multiples)
3. How many employees? (3-7 target range?)
4. What % recurring revenue mentioned? (50%+ target)
5. Why is owner selling? (Retirement, burnout, opportunity?)
6. How long has it been listed? (Fresh or stale listing?)

**Output: Deal Flow Scorecard**
```
Category 1 (Regulatory Services): X/5 types have 10+ listings
Category 2 (Insurance): X/4 types have 10+ listings
Category 3 (Industrial Support): X/5 types have 10+ listings
Category 4 (Infrastructure/Facilities): X/4 types have 10+ listings

TOTAL PASSES: X/18 business types
```

**Decision Point:** If <6 business types pass, your thesis may be too restrictive. Consider expanding geography beyond SoCal.

---

#### Day 3 (Wednesday): Licensing Feasibility Deep Dive
**Objective:** Confirm licensing is NOT a 5-year barrier for top 10 business types

**Method: Direct Source Research (3-4 hours)**

For each business type that PASSED deal flow test, research:

**Question 1: What licenses/certifications are required?**
- Federal level? (EPA, FAA, etc.)
- State level? (California CSLB, DOI, professional engineering, etc.)
- Local level? (Municipal, county?)

**Question 2: Can license transfer with business purchase?**
- Call state licensing board: "If I buy a business with [license type], does license transfer?"
- Document: Transferable / Non-transferable / Requires new application

**Question 3: If non-transferable, how long to obtain?**
- Education requirements?
- Experience requirements? (years, hours)
- Exam requirements? (pass rate, difficulty)
- Realistic timeline: X weeks/months

**Question 4: Can we hire licensed person instead?**
- Is "qualifying party" structure allowed? (Licensed employee signs off on work?)
- Labor market: Are licensed professionals available for hire?
- Typical salary: $X for licensed person in this field

**Research Sources:**
- **California CSLB** (cslb.ca.gov) - Contractor licenses
- **California DOI** (insurance.ca.gov) - Insurance licenses
- **Professional associations** - Certification bodies (ASSE, ASNT, NICET, etc.)
- **Google:** "[license type] requirements California"

**Scoring Rules:**
- 🟢 **PASS:** License transfers OR obtainable in <3 months OR can hire licensed manager
- 🟡 **MARGINAL:** Requires 3-12 months training OR expensive ($100k+ salary) licensed hire
- 🔴 **FAIL:** Requires 2+ year apprenticeship AND non-transferable AND rare labor market

**Output: Licensing Feasibility Matrix**

| Business Type | License Required | Transferable? | Time to Obtain | Hire Option? | SCORE |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Example: Backflow | ASSE Backflow Cert | N/A (cert not license) | 1-2 weeks ($500 course) | Not needed | 🟢 PASS |
| Example: Gov't Contract | None | N/A | N/A | N/A | 🟢 PASS |
| Example: Insurance Broker | CA Insurance License | No | 4-12 weeks (exam) | Yes ($60-80k) | 🟢 PASS |
| Example: Environmental | CIH, CHMM | No | 5+ years experience | Yes ($90-120k) | 🟡 MARGINAL |
| Example: Elevator | CA Elevator Mechanic | No | 4-5 years apprentice | Yes ($100-130k) | 🔴 FAIL |

**Decision Point:** Eliminate all 🔴 FAIL business types. These are licensing traps.

---

#### Day 4-5 (Thursday-Friday): Quick Financial Sanity Check
**Objective:** Confirm "typical" businesses in remaining types can hit return targets

**Method: Back-of-Envelope Underwriting (3-4 hours)**

For each business type that passed Deal Flow + Licensing:

**Step 1: Gather Data from BizBuySell Listings**
- Find 3-5 recent listings in this business type
- Extract: Revenue, SDE/EBITDA, Asking Price, # Employees

**Step 2: Calculate Key Metrics**
```
Asking Multiple = Asking Price / SDE
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue (estimate if not disclosed)
SDE Margin = SDE / Revenue
Revenue per Employee = Revenue / # Employees
```

**Step 3: Build Simple Acquisition Model**
```
Example: Backflow Testing Business

Purchase Price: $180,000 (3x SDE)
SDE (Seller's Discretionary Earnings): $60,000
Revenue: $350,000
Employees: 4 (1 manager + 3 techs)

Post-Acquisition Changes:
- Replace owner salary with manager: -$0 (manager already in place, promote)
- Add owner's benefits back: +$10,000 (health insurance, etc.)
- Adjusted EBITDA: $70,000

Return Scenarios:
Base Case: Hold 5 years, exit at 5x EBITDA
- Exit value: $70k * 5 = $350k
- Return: $350k / $180k = 1.94x MOIC, 14% IRR
- Cash distributions (Years 2-5): $20k/year * 4 = $80k
- Total return: $350k + $80k - $180k = $250k profit (2.4x MOIC, 19% IRR)

Bear Case: Revenue drops 20%, exit at 4x
- Exit EBITDA: $56k (20% revenue drop, same margin%)
- Exit value: $56k * 4 = $224k
- Return: $224k / $180k = 1.24x MOIC, 4.4% IRR (UNACCEPTABLE)

Bull Case: Acquire 2 more in same market (route density), exit at 6x
- [Build out 3-business rollup model]
- Exit value: $1.2M+ on $500k invested = 2.4x MOIC, 30%+ IRR
```

**Key Questions:**
1. Does base case hit 15%+ IRR minimum? (If no, ELIMINATE)
2. Is bear case survivable? (If we lose money, ELIMINATE)
3. Is bull case realistic? (Can we actually execute rollup?)

**Data Sources (if BizBuySell insufficient):**
- **BizBuySell Sold Data** ($99/month) - Historical transaction multiples
- **Vertical IQ** (free trial) - Industry margin benchmarks
- **RMA Annual Statement Studies** (library) - Financial ratios by industry

**Output: Financial Viability Scorecard**

| Business Type | Typical Multiple | Base Case IRR | Bear Case IRR | Bull Case IRR | SCORE |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Backflow Testing | 2.5-3.5x SDE | 19% | 4% | 30%+ | 🟢 PASS |
| Gov't Contract | 3-4x SDE | 12% | -2% | 18% | 🔴 FAIL |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Scoring Rules:**
- 🟢 **PASS:** Base case >15% IRR, Bear case >0% IRR
- 🟡 **MARGINAL:** Base case 10-15% IRR (lower return, but acceptable if other factors strong)
- 🔴 **FAIL:** Base case <10% IRR OR bear case shows loss (too risky for $200k bet)

---

### Week 1 Output: The Shortlist (4-6 Business Types)

**Expected Result After Week 1:**
- Started with 18 business types
- Eliminated 12-14 based on:
  - Deal flow (<10 listings)
  - Licensing barriers (>2 year pathway)
  - Financial viability (<10% base case IRR)
- **Remaining: 4-6 business types** that pass ALL three tests

**Example Shortlist (Hypothetical):**
1. Backflow Testing (90%+ recurring, easy licensing, 19% base IRR)
2. Calibration Services (80%+ recurring, hire certified techs, 25% base IRR)
3. Fire Protection Inspection (70%+ recurring, hire licensed techs, 16% base IRR)
4. Specialty Insurance Brokers (70%+ recurring, 4-12 week license, 14% base IRR)
5. NDT Services (70%+ recurring, hire ASNT certified, 22% base IRR)

**Decision Checkpoint:**
- Do we have 4-6 viable options? YES → Proceed to Week 2
- Do we have <4 options? Re-evaluate thesis or expand geography

---

## Week 2: Primary Research (Owner Conversations)
**Time Investment:** 12-15 hours
**Cost:** $0 (time only)
**Outcome:** Validate assumptions with people who ACTUALLY run these businesses
**Deliverable:** Sector recommendation based on REALITY not theory

---

### Why Owner Conversations Matter More Than Research Reports

**The Problem with Desk Research:**
- Industry reports tell you market size (useless - you're buying ONE business)
- Financial benchmarks tell you averages (useless - every business is unique)
- Macro trends tell you tailwinds (useless if specific businesses have problems)

**What Owner Conversations Reveal:**
- "I spend 80% of my time chasing invoices" → Working capital / collections problem
- "My biggest customer is 60% of revenue" → Customer concentration risk (ELIMINATE)
- "I haven't taken a vacation in 5 years" → Not remote manageable (ELIMINATE)
- "The city inspector knows me by name" → Owner-dependent relationships (RISK)
- "We have 3 certified techs who've been here 10+ years" → Stable, transferable (GOOD)

**The Data You Can't Get from Research:**
- How hard is owner transition REALLY? (Owners will tell you truth if asked right)
- What's the #1 reason customers leave? (Reveals stickiness reality)
- What % of work is truly recurring vs. "repeat customers"? (Big difference)
- How much does owner WANT to sell vs. "testing market"? (Motivation matters)

---

### Day 6-8 (Monday-Wednesday): Cold Outreach Campaign
**Objective:** Book 3-5 informational calls per business type (15-20 total calls)

**Method 1: BizBuySell Listing Outreach (Easiest)**

**Script (Email to broker or direct):**
```
Subject: Question about [Business Name] listing

Hi [Broker/Owner Name],

I came across your listing for [Business Name] on BizBuySell (Listing #XXXXX).

I'm in early stages of research on acquiring a business in the [industry] space.
Before submitting any formal inquiries, I'm doing informational interviews with
owners to understand the industry better.

Would the seller be open to a 15-20 minute call where I could ask some general
questions about operating this type of business? I'm not ready to make an offer yet,
but if the conversation goes well, I'd certainly consider this business seriously
down the road.

Happy to sign NDA if needed. My background: [1 sentence - technical background,
systems building, nuclear regulatory experience]

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

**Method 2: Trade Association Directory Outreach (Better for unbiased info)**

**Script (Email to non-sellers):**
```
Subject: Informational interview request - [Industry] business owner

Hi [Owner Name],

I found your company through [Association Name] directory. I'm researching the
[industry] space with the goal of acquiring a business in the next 6-12 months.

Would you be open to a brief 15-20 minute phone call where I could ask some
questions about your experience running this type of business? I'm not looking
to buy your business specifically (unless you're coincidentally looking to sell!),
just trying to learn from operators in the field.

I'm particularly interested in understanding:
- What a typical day/week looks like operationally
- What skills are most critical for success
- What you wish you'd known before starting/buying

Happy to buy you coffee if you're local (SoCal), or just a quick call if easier.

Background: [1 sentence about relevant experience]

Thanks for considering,
[Your Name]
```

### Day 9-12 (Thursday-Sunday): Execute Owner Interviews
**Objective:** Complete 15-25 calls, gather intel on each business type

**Interview Structure (15-20 minutes):**

**Opening (1-2 min):**
"Thanks for taking the time. As mentioned, I'm researching [industry] businesses for potential acquisition.

[If seller seems motivated] "And just to be clear, if you are considering selling at some point, I'd definitely be interested in continuing the conversation once I've finished my research."

---

### Day 12-13 (Sunday-Monday): Synthesize Learnings
**Objective:** Score each business type based on REAL data from owners

**Analysis Framework: "What Did We Learn?"**

For each business type, document:

**1. Owner Role Reality Check**
- Is owner truly a manager/systems builder OR are they the key technician?
- Can business operate with owner gone for 2-3 weeks?
- What's the REAL transition timeline? (Owners often say "3-6 months" but mean 12-18)

**2. Recurring Revenue Verification**
- What % said "truly recurring" (contracts, mandated) vs. "repeat customers"?
- How many mentioned customer churn issues?
- Are customers sticky because of regulation OR because of relationships?

**3. Hidden Operational Complexity**
- What surprised us? (Things not visible in listings or research)
- What did EVERY owner mention as hard? (Common pain points = systemic issues)
- What regulatory/compliance burdens did they emphasize?

**4. Value Creation Opportunities**
- What do owners wish they had built? (Software, systems, automation)
- Where do they waste time? (Manual processes we could systematize)
- What growth opportunities exist? (Geographic expansion, service lines, etc.)

**5. Seller Motivation & Market Timing**
- How many owners expressed interest in selling within 12 months?
- What's driving exits? (Retirement, burnout, opportunity cost, market conditions)
- Is there urgency OR are they "fishing" for high offers?

**6. Disqualifying Factors Revealed**
- Did any business type reveal deal-breakers? (e.g., "Every business has 1-2 huge customers", "Impossible to hire techs", "Owner relationships are everything")

**Output: Owner Interview Scorecard**

| Business Type | Calls Completed | Owner-Manageable? | Recurring Verified? | Hidden Complexity? | Seller Motivation? | OVERALL |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| Backflow | 5 | ✅ Yes (3+ techs typical) | ✅ Yes (90%+ mandated) | ✅ Low (route-based, straightforward) | ✅ High (retirement wave) | 🟢 STRONG |
| Gov't Contract | 4 | ❌ No (owner writes proposals) | 🟡 Mixed (60% retainers but at-risk) | ❌ High (DCAA audit complexity) | 🟡 Mixed | 🔴 WEAK |
| Insurance Broker | 5 | 🟡 Maybe (need strong producer) | ✅ Yes (70%+ renewals) | 🟡 Moderate (customer concentration common) | ✅ High (boomer exits) | 🟡 MAYBE |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Week 2 Output: Conviction Ranking

**Expected Result After Week 2:**
- Started Week 2 with 4-6 business types
- After owner conversations, clear picture emerges:
  - **1-2 types:** "This is clearly the right fit" (STRONG conviction)
  - **2-3 types:** "This could work but has risks" (MODERATE conviction)
  - **1-2 types:** "This is NOT what we thought" (ELIMINATE)

**Example Output:**

**TIER 1: STRONG CONVICTION (Ready to Focus)**
1. **Backflow Testing**
   - Owner interviews: 5/5 confirmed easy transition, 90%+ recurring, route-based
   - Seller motivation: 4/5 owners 60+ years old, ready to retire
   - Hidden upside: Every owner said "I wish I had software for scheduling/reporting"
   - **DECISION: This is THE sector**

**TIER 2: MODERATE CONVICTION (Backup Option)**
2. **Calibration Services**
   - Owner interviews: 4/5 confirmed recurring, but hiring certified techs is challenging
   - Seller motivation: Mixed (some retiring, some growing and not selling)
   - Hidden complexity: ISO 17025 audit compliance is significant burden
   - **DECISION: Pursue if Tier 1 fails**

**TIER 3: WEAK CONVICTION (Eliminate)**
3. **Government Contract Administration**
   - Owner interviews: 4/4 said "I am the business" (proposal writing, relationships)
   - Transition: "Took me 10 years to build agency relationships"
   - Customer concentration: 3/4 had >50% revenue from 1-2 agencies
   - **DECISION: ELIMINATE**

---

## Week 3: Strategic Validation & Decision
**Time Investment:** 8-10 hours
**Cost:** $500-1,000 (industry reports, association memberships)
**Outcome:** Final GO/NO-GO decision on ONE sector
**Deliverable:** Sector focus decision memo + 90-day action plan

---

### Day 14-15 (Tuesday-Wednesday): Macro/Strategic Validation
**Objective:** Confirm your #1 choice has durable tailwinds (not just good deals today)

For your TOP 1-2 business types only (don't waste time on others):

**Question 1: Is the macro tailwind real?**
- **For Industrial/Infrastructure:** Find data on reshoring (jobs, facilities, CapEx)
- **For Compliance/Regulatory:** Find data on new regulations, compliance spend increasing
- **For Insurance:** Find data on specialty lines growth, rate environment

**Data Sources:**
- Google: "[industry] market size 2026", "[industry] growth rate"
- Trade associations: Join (typically $200-500) and access member reports
- IBISWorld: Buy ONE report for your top choice ($300-1,500)

**Question 2: Is AI disruption overstated or understated?**
- Break down the work: What % is physical, what % is desk work?
- For desk work: Is it judgment-based or routine?
- Talk to 1-2 technology people in the space: "What software/AI tools are you seeing?"

**Question 3: Is PE/strategic M&A active in this space?**
- Search: "[industry] acquisition", "[industry] private equity"
- Look for: Roll-up activity, recent transactions, active consolidators
- Why this matters: Active M&A = proven exit path

**Output: Strategic Validation Brief (2-3 pages)**
```
Industry: Backflow Testing & Cross-Connection Control

1. MARKET SIZE & GROWTH
   - TAM: $800M-$1.2B (US)
   - Growth: 5-7% CAGR (driven by new construction, regulatory enforcement)
   - Sources: [Industry association report, IBISWorld]

2. MACRO TAILWINDS
   - Commercial construction rebound (more buildings = more backflow devices)
   - Water safety regulations tightening (more enforcement, stricter testing)
   - Aging infrastructure (more backflow devices need replacement/testing)

3. AI DISRUPTION ASSESSMENT
   - Physical testing: 80% of work (CANNOT be automated)
   - Scheduling/reporting: 15% of work (CAN be automated - our opportunity!)
   - Customer communication: 5% of work (CAN be automated)
   - CONCLUSION: LOW disruption risk, HIGH automation opportunity for differentiation

4. M&A ACTIVITY
   - Recent transactions: [List 3-5 if found]
   - Active buyers: Regional consolidators, facility services PE platforms
   - Valuation multiples: 3-4x SDE for SMBs, 6-7x EBITDA for platforms
   - CONCLUSION: Clear exit path exists

5. RISKS
   - Municipal budget cuts could reduce enforcement
   - Technology (IoT sensors) could disrupt in 10+ years
   - Labor availability for technicians
```

**Key Questions:**
1. Are there active PE roll-ups in this space? (If yes, validates exit path)
2. What multiples are being paid? (Aligns with your underwriting?)
3. Are deals competitive (multiple bidders) or quiet (off-market)? (Indicates sourcing difficulty)

**Output: Competitive Landscape Brief (1 page)**
```
Who's Buying Backflow Testing Businesses?

1. PE Roll-Ups: [Names if any, or "None identified"]
2. Strategic Acquirers: Regional facility services companies, fire protection consolidators
3. Individual Buyers: Existing operators expanding, entrepreneurs (like us)

CONCLUSION: Minimal PE competition (too small), mostly strategic/individual buyers.
Good for us = less competitive bidding, more reasonable multiples.

## PART 4: DECISION

**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION:** Focus 100% on [Sector Name]

**Rationale:**
[2-3 paragraphs explaining why this is THE sector]

**Alternative Actions Considered:**

## Part 4: Why This Plan Works for Micro PE

**1. It's Capital-Efficient**
- Spends <$2k to validate $200k decision (0.8% of capital)
- Most research is free (owner conversations, BizBuySell browsing)
- Only buys paid data for TOP choice, not all 18 types

**2. It's Time-Efficient**
- 3 weeks to decision vs. 3 months (you have full-time jobs)
- Front-loads elimination (kills bad ideas fast)
- Focuses deep work on 1-2 finalists only

**3. It's Action-Oriented**
- Week 1: Can you find 10 deals? (Objective, clear answer)
- Week 2: Do owners confirm thesis? (Primary validation)
- Week 3: Do we have conviction? (GO/NO-GO decision)

**4. It De-Risks the Biggest Unknowns**
- **Unknown #1:** "Are there actually businesses for sale?" → Answered Week 1
- **Unknown #2:** "Can we transition without owner?" → Answered Week 2
- **Unknown #3:** "Will returns hit our hurdle?" → Answered Week 1
- **Unknown #4:** "Is our thesis grounded in reality?" → Answered Week 2

**5. It Builds Option Value**
- 20+ owner conversations = 20+ future deal sources
- Broker relationships = inbound deal flow
- Industry associations = credibility + network
- Even if first sector fails, you have methodology for next

## Part 5: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: "Let's research all 18 types equally"
**Why it's wrong:** With $200k, you can only pursue ONE sector. Don't pretend you can diversify.
**Right approach:** Eliminate fast, focus deep on 1-2 finalists.

### Mistake #2: "Let's read industry reports first"
**Why it's wrong:** Reports tell you about industries, not specific businesses you can buy TODAY.
**Right approach:** Start with "Are there 10 deals?" then learn about industry.

### Mistake #3: "Let's build detailed financial models"
**Why it's wrong:** Hypothetical models before confirming deal flow = analysis paralysis.
**Right approach:** Rough models (back-of-envelope) for screening, detailed models for specific LOI targets.

### Mistake #4: "Let's only talk to sellers"
**Why it's wrong:** Sellers have bias (want to paint rosy picture).
**Right approach:** Talk to both sellers AND non-sellers for unbiased operational reality.

### Mistake #5: "Let's take 6 months to decide"
**Why it's wrong:** Analysis paralysis, and in 6 months best deals are gone.
**Right approach:** 3 weeks to decision, then 3-6 months to close first deal.

## Final Thought: The 80/20 of Sector Selection

**80% of your success comes from:**
1. **Deal flow** (Are businesses actually for sale?)
2. **Transition feasibility** (Can you operate it?)
3. **Owner conversations** (Reality check your thesis)

**20% of your success comes from:**
- Market size analysis
- Competitive landscape reports
- Macro trend forecasting
- Technology disruption modeling

**Micro PE Principle:** Do the 80% first, only dive deep on 20% for your final choice.
